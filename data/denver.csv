Very personable and very knowledgeable. I am currently aiming for a new hair style but don't really know how to go about achieving it myself. Lauren was really great at listening to what I envisioned, answering my questions or explaining things I didn't know about how to achieve my desired hairstyle, and bringing that to life. The haircut itself was great! Additionally, for this new style it will be a process as my hair continues to grow, and Lauren was great about explaining that, making notes in my profile for next time (I love the attention to detail and customer service with making notes like this), and explaining what I can do in the meantime to help me along that process.

I had booked an appointment with Sean, and I wish I had waited a couple of days for a barber with more reviews. Sean was super friendly, and I told him I wanted a 3 on the sides and half the length on top. He was great about asking if I preferred the 3 all the way up to the top or if I liked it more blended as it goes up, and if I meant half an inch off the top or half the length. After discussing it with him, I made the mistake of not watching him in the mirror. Not even a minute after discussing what I wanted, I felt the clippers go over the top of my head, and by the time I looked up, he had already taken the 3 guard to half the top of my head. I was pretty disappointed because if he had forgotten what I wanted, he should've just asked before shaving my head. It's not something worth yelling about, as it's just hair, but now I am going to have to spend twice as much getting the sides cleaned up as I let the top regrow over the next three months. I will say he did a great job cleaning up the back of my head, and he was super communicative in making sure the back looked the way I wanted; if only he had done that for the top of my head too. I understand mistakes happen, as we are all human, but it never hurts to double-check what someone wants.

I decided to give Frank's a shot and wow, so glad I did! I booked online which was super simple, and got there early to grab a parking spot since it is downtown off Larimer. Headed inside, was greeted/checked in and was told to wash my hands which I liked. They then asked if I wanted anything to drink and it being my day off, I went the local craft beer route and got a Strawberry Rhubarb Sour Ale by Great Divide (their beer selection is spot on, even got a koozie for the can). I was then told to take a seat in their lounge area dubbed the \""man cave\"" which is the only thing I happened to take pictures of while there. They had all kinds of things available while waiting, from chips, snacks, suckers, even condoms which I thought was a nice touch. I hung out in there for a few minutes before Addison came and introduced herself and took me to her chair.\n\nNow back home in Houston, I had the same barber for about 7 years and I have spent some time here in Denver looking for anyone comparable to her- and I think Addison just may be that fit. She was amazing, listened to every detail on what I was looking for with a haircut, and was very personable but also professional. I was so impressed by her work I'll definitely be going back and requesting her as well. Highly recommend her for anyone reading this review! My bar is set pretty high, and she went above and beyond. Facility was very nice and well kept, loved how clean everything was.\n\nA couple of pro tips, get there early because of street parking. I went during the day which was fine, but you always need to be prepared going downtown to find a spot unless you are walking/scooting/biking. Coors Field is two blocks away, so I can see parking not even being an option during baseball season. Also Addison told me a lot of people book in the evening and come in for a beer and a cut, then head out on the town afterwards which is not a bad place to be to get the night started!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNAcLVv6tMUxneDzQd0XBB6mWytIs4uxP1gJgac\u0026fid=0x0:0xdbd81559303c376a""],""When"":""2024-1-27""},{""Name"":""Dan Ramsey"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXlCO_Tv_vGIzhydQdw_SOeJ_ftcu2JoHjbAVf0equkTQcjYb_V=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I’ve been going here for over 3 years and still love it.

The barber, while a nice individual, didn't deliver the results I expected. I'm puzzled by the practice of some barbers turning their clients away from the mirror during the haircut. In my case, the barber rotated my chair away from the mirror, leading me to blindly trust his skills. Regrettably, the final look was quite displeasing. It gave me the impression that ensuring client satisfaction isn't their top priority. Instead, it seems the focus is on quick service: cut the hair as rapidly as possible, collect payment, and then swiftly move on to the next customer.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for improvement:\n1. Always keep your client facing the mirror while you're cutting their hair. This allows them to see the progress and provide immediate feedback, which can help in achieving a haircut that meets their expectations.\n2.

They do other community functions like sponsoring families for the holidays making sure kids have presents to open on Christmas or serving a warm meal. There are times when I have come for my appointment and they are feeding patrons in the barbershop just because.\n\nThe owner, Mike is very professional and gives a warm welcome to all entering the establishment. He's a strong male figure and has no problem talking to the young boys.\n\nShellie, my current is the only female working in the barbershop. She has been my barber since she joined the team. She has given me guidance on keeping my hair the best it can be. She is constantly upping her game doing new things like steam treatments and Scalp Micropigmentation.\n\nThe most important thing about the barbershop, they don't discriminate. All races, religions, genders, and economic statuses (rich, poor, and anywhere in between) are welcome without judgment. The ONLY requirement is to be respectful.\n\nRecently, the shop has received bad press because of a resident living above the barbershop.

There was one other person in the shop waiting for another stylist. Taylor went ahead and took me back. I was getting an undercut design and eye brows. My eye brows turned out amazing. 🤩 Taylor was nice and the shop was clean. As for my design for my undercut, I asked him 3 times if he could do what I wanted and if not we could do something else. He agreed to do the design I wanted and said he could. During the cut I asked if he would like to see the design again. He said no. As a person with 13 years of experience, I trusted him! Once done with the design, it wasn’t what I wanted but I thought it looked okay in the mirror. I paid/tipped, and left. Once in my car I took a picture and really looked at it. It looks like a vagina. I’ve had multiple people comment the same thing and it’s only been a day. I wasn’t going to write a review but I just feel embarrassed I have to have this on my head for two week. Taylor may be great at other hair styles no doubt but designs not so much. I hate to say I’m unhappy with the results.

There are some things you should know before you go here.\n\nThe good: My cut was good nothing above average and my barber was a nice cool guy. This was my first time going to this place so I walked in to a completely dead barbershop. I asked the Barber if he had time for a walk in or if he had someone scheduled soon. He said no I’m good and I sat down for my cut.\n\nThe Bad: Once the cut was over is when the the issue that makes me not want to ever go back occurred. I was informed that since I didn’t have an appointment as a walk in my costs was $75 instead of the normal $55. Now if I had pushed off or impeded someone existing appointment I could understand being charged a premium for that but I didn’t. The barber would have sat there with no business and make zero dollars instead of some money. It didn’t feel right to me to pay extra for filling his otherwise empty schedule. Then I found out the only way to pay was Zelle or cash. Since I didn’t readily have those options available I went to try and find a working ATM. That didn’t work out so I had to transfer funds to another account just so I could pay with Zelle.\n\nIt seems like if you have a policy to charge people more who you know it’s their first visit at a minimum you would inform them of that before you started your service so they can choose if it’s worth it or not. I could have made an appointment for later or booked the appointment through Booksy at that moment if I had been told. No one even gave me the option. Also if you can only accept limited funds that means you can’t accept a physical card so that also would have been nice to know up front.\n\nSo hopefully if you are going there for the first time at least you can learn from my experience and decide for yourself if it’s worth it. Again the folks were nice and the cut was good but not above average so paying $75 for it just didn’t sit right with me at all."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Devin Coyazo"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXbLYD1r3RRzIFuHizKj4KAhnY0Y0q6bE-sxzE30QAgvWvg9thE=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""This guy is truly exceptional.

Turns out that has never been the case! I won't name names of these other shops I've tried: places with skateboard decks on the wall, places with training certificates plastered up of at famous barber schools in Amsterdam, places with fancy whiskey bottles on the counter, places with stalls located in trendy \""food halls,\"" and so on and so on. I've just never had a great haircut at any of these places. Sure the banter is fun, but it's all just a bit too much in the ego department, and none of these \""dudes\"" really cared about a good customer experience, it seemed?\n\nWhich brings me to Blank Barbers on Pearl Street! As a personal aside: I recently dropped about 35 pounds, and was very scraggly looking, with a long gray beard and a thick near-mullet after not having anything done in about nine months. I just was not feeing my best mentally and physically, but after shedding some weight, I was ready to look my best again everywhere else. I did some research on Blank, and found their stylist bios extremely useful, and found a nice match in Bri Almutairi. Meeting her on the day of my cut, she put me at ease right away. I showed her a picture of my last good cut, many years (and many pounds ago), and said I wanted something similar. It felt like a collaboration from the beginning, which was very refreshing. She had a few questions but really I just wanted her to guide the appointment with her knowledge and experience, and she did not disappoint! I also had the beard completely shaved, with only a perfectly sculpted mustache remaining.\n\nWe had a nice chat, but the small talk never felt forced. She checked in with me about how things looked, but still asserted a great confidence in what would make me look my best. Just a wonderful, balanced experience all around.\n\nThe location itself is lovely. No tattoo shop vibes, nor a pretentious, faux-classy joint either. Just a clean, well lit place with some lovely cactus, vinyl spinning on the record player, and the offer of a free espresso upon arrival, which I gladly accepted.

I asked for a mid fade, but he gave me a high fade, which was not what I wanted. While he’s a super nice person and I don’t know if there was a miscommunication, I just really was not a fan of the haircut he gave me.\n\nUPDATE: The owner went above and beyond by offering to cover my next haircut, even though it wasn't necessary.

A good haircut and beard trim is something I don’t mind paying good money, traveling and tipping well for.\n\nWith that said, after some extensive research, I had high hopes for World Class Men’s Cuts. However, after leaving with a beard accident and bad drivers, coupled  with my long drive back to Fort Collins, I found myself up in my feelings of being irritated a bit. I found it to be several hours mostly wasted with gas, time, money and a value I don’t think I received.\n\nOn to the experience: I schedule with Jordan, whom I assume is the owner. Jordan was welcoming and a nice guy when I arrived. He offered me something to drink as well. I sat down in the chair at approximately 1:24PM. After a brief 3-4 minute conversation I thought to myself “this guy knows what he’s doing” and with my research, I felt destined for success. We went and he washed my hair and then I returned to the seat for my haircut and beard trim. (I mention these steps for a reason.) Jordan did some trimming on my hair and then went to my beard. Next comes the accident, at one point when he was lowering his arm with the trimmer turned on, he grazed my beard cutting the hair nearly to the skin. I felt it immediately but did not say anything. I’m not one to cause a scene, business is earned and lost everyday on interactions and this is where my thoughts go in moments like this. Jordan didn’t say anything after the accident. Therefore, I assume he didn’t know or didn’t want to say something, either way I’m not sure which is worse. He finished my beard, then my hair and added some product. When I got to the counter to pay, I looked at the time…1:53PM. I was able to have a conversation, get my hair washed, a haircut and a beard trim…all in 29 minutes and a $75 bill w/o tip to seal the deal. Had my beard and haircut came out looking magnificent, I would have had a problem (as I eluded to in my second sentence in this review) but this isn’t the case. While I am satisfied with the haircut, my beard experience has taken the front seat. Not only was there an accident with my beard, it’s also longer on the right bottom side versus the left. Now my wife, who use to groom dogs has to fix it…kind of adds some comedic relief to the full story.\n\nUpdate: Jordan did message to apologize and refunded $30."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMpzFc54Y4Vbkw3he6cuWjltx_G8bBHCnAiSGAX\u0026fid=0x0:0xe68ec9831c364e8""],""When"":""2022-5-1""},{""Name"":""md2128"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL4eyLO7qJQD43dEDeWd0cZjzWUCdPYQzlPrvM3-hvslKwjgA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Out of town traveler needing a cut.

The barbers at Supreme'z are skilled professionals, but they can only deliver what you communicate to them. It's crucial to clearly express your preferences and be specific about what you want. If you don't communicate effectively, you may walk out with a cut that doesn't meet your expectations.

The blowout and the service was fine, but after washing out all of curls and product the next day I realized my hair was thinned out significantly More than necessary and the cut itself was very uneven. I was not shown my cut before the stylist began putting my hair in roller brushes for styling. I called the salon and asked if there was anything we could do to correct this and the only option was to return to the salon within 7 days of the original cut to have the same stylist fix the cut at no cost. I find it unfair to be expected to go back to the same stylist after such an unfortunate result, not even considering it would be 2-3 days before I’d be able to get it corrected. My cut and wash totaled to over $110 plus tip, not cheap! The picture of the female in the mask was a reference picture my stylist was positive she could execute.

Blow drying my thick hair can take ages, and this has been rushed in previous experiences at other salons. But Harper sectioned off my hair to thoroughly dry and style each part without rushing the process. She also gave a great head massage at the beginning! Really pleased with the whole experience and outcome.

I asked for very minimal layers as I was nervous. The first time I straightened my hair after this cut i was in shock. It took 2 months and 2 hair cuts to fix this and it’s just disappointing that this wasn’t clarified because I would have never gotten a curly cut if I had known this would be the result.

five stars, I would. This salon is hands-down the best experience we’ve ever had. From start to finish, they treated my daughter with such care, patience, and artistry—it was beyond anything I could have hoped for.\n\nRiley did her original butterfly cut about a month ago, and it was absolutely stunning. My daughter has always struggled with her hair, and Riley gave her something low-maintenance yet beautiful, boosting her confidence in a way I can’t even put into words.\n\nThen came the color—something my daughter has been dreaming of for years. Now that she’s hitting the big 1-0, I finally said yes to a little rainbow magic (just not all the way to the roots), and Raegen made that dream a reality. The blending is flawless, the tones are vibrant yet soft, and the level of detail she put into every strand shows how much she truly cares.\n\nBut what really sets this salon apart isn’t just the talent—it’s the heart. When my daughter had a last-minute change of mind and we couldn’t finish in one session, Raegen, out of pure kindness, came in on her day off just to make sure my daughter got exactly what she wanted. I know how demanding this industry is—long hours, little rest, standing all day—and yet she still went above and beyond for us.\n\nI will never take my daughter anywhere else. This salon is the perfect mix of luxury and warmth—a place where you feel like family while still getting a high-end experience.

I was left standing around for about 10 minutes until the receptionist finally appeared. When she did, she was not only rude but also seemed uninterested in helping.\n\nThe stylist who did my balayage and cut was super friendly, but I believe she may not be well-versed in working with blonde hair. After shampooing my hair, she remarked, “Well, it’s definitely not going to be as blonde as you wanted. I would recommend not waiting so long to color again.” For context, I’m already blonde and have previously transitioned to even an icy white blonde without any issues.. through balayage and foils.\n\nDuring the blowout, the stylist mentioned that her blow dryer was on its last leg, and it showed in the results. My blowout was far from what I expected—it was flat as a board. While the final color isn’t absolutely awful, it’s very brassy and not what I anticipated or we talked about. Please see final hair right after it was done and reference photo."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMN4_xcpkWAElr-rr1NCJbKC29msjBFDUBvWB73\u0026fid=0x0:0x3b58f8eeb4eef112""],""When"":""2024-8-28""}]",

My hair stylist was Sarah. I came in for a test strand because I had black box dye on, which I understand takes time for me to go from dark to lighter hair. Sarah told me my hair lifted good enough for a caramel balayage, and that was the reason I booked an appointment with her to get my hair done. I showed her the picture on the left, and she said my hair would turn out close to that color. The right pic is what my hair looked like one day after I got my hair done (I did wash my hair with the purple shampoo that Sarah told me was a good shampoo). She turned my hair from uneven to extremely uneven! I texted her about it, and she said because she got too excited, she toned my hair lighter than she should have and told me to come in and she would fix it, but she would have to tone it to a dark brown with warmth. The fact that she told me it was going to be a caramel balayage and then proceeded to ruin my hair, and now she wants to tone it dark? I am now paying more money to get my hair fixed somewhere else, and this salon will not refund me my money even though their hair stylist ruined my hair."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMOanusIBJkRaK6bf9Eh9OEoTh0kmXbHbQgHeSu\u0026fid=0x0:0xf0b70f39b3e94067""],""When"":""2024-12-19""},{""Name"":""Colleen Smith"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUhRufphHclm-ewH5_FvF_fGhWKeZKllo-g4pPi1-GErSIKRxBw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Vincent was SO wonderful.

With that being said I wanted to give a review about a balayage + cut service I got (for my balayage girlies that want a comprehensive review).  For some background, I use to get a balayage in California every ~5-6 months but have since let my hair grow out to my virgin state. I was pretty nervous about visiting a new salon so I paid extra to book an appointment with the owner/top stylist. For my service at DECO I showed a picture of my first ever balayage (pictured in grey sweatshirt), and I left the salon disappointed (pictured in the red jacket). The color was nice, it just was not even close to what I had asked for and I was a little disappointed to pay so much (~400 $ with tip) and not get what I was expecting. When I expressed that my hair was not as light as I had wanted during my appointment, I was told that AVEDA doesn't use bleach so that my hair will be more healthy, and that I should just keep on booking appointments because it takes a couple sessions to get to the correct color. This doesn't really seem worth it to me (given the price of each session) and I'll probably look for another salon to get my balayage done."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNVOO7pMMdX1OYUYSePIdVNwvYDGRRyOiRBiGEW\u0026fid=0x0:0xf0b70f39b3e94067""],""When"":""2024-2-28""},{""Name"":""Laura Van Dusen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV_Z8dVE5Yc-jbIgsYsv5R3keRkPfXl27prwwB2XBmjVp8FEsM=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Panda is a true gem!

I was referred to the salon and Ariana after a friend spoke very highly of her. I had a consultation with Ariana to make sure I was a good fit (which I love this practice because as a curly girl, I’ve had my fair share of cuts that didn’t work (including a deva cut at their flagship salon). We talked about my texture and styling preferences and agreed it was a match. My first cut from Ariana was incredible. I was able to maintain length/hair health while also creating space for growing into a new shape. I just had my second cut with Ariana this past week. I am telling you, I’ve never felt more empowered and in my element with a hair cut in my life. The shape is incredible, it was able to maintain length again (several people telling me that my hair looked longer!!), and it looked great with minimal styling. I am so so so grateful to have found Ariana.\n\nThe salon also! Is super aware of your time and money, which I really appreciate. They have a rate system which I haven’t seen at other spots. At the end of my cut, Ariana asked me if I wanted to finish the appointment then and save money or do a wash and reset. Because it was a curl cut, I had already washed my hair before the appointment and opted to not rewash to retain moisture. Ariana then refunded the rest of my appointment, which was huge!!

I had a gut feeling that it would not come out good; but I figured that different stylist did things differently and I was going to be impressed when she finished. I read the reviews online that the salon does a good job with curly hair; but didn’t know which stylist was good for curly cut. I  saw other women in the salon with very similar hair texture as mine go to other stylists; and I knew right in there that I had picked the wrong stylist. The first three photos you can see my hair is very uneven with a hole in my right side,  the 4th photo after I applied mousse very uneven bangs, the 5th  photo is what my hair looks like through out; the 6th photo after I styled my hair the left side is longer than the right side; the 7th and 8th photos is what my hair looked before Rebekah cut my hair; last photo is what I asked her to do with my hair and I showed her that photo. I will return to the salon because I felt very at home at the salon; and every body was very nice; but I will not book with Rebekah again, she may be good at other things, but not for natural curly hair or haircuts.\n\nReply to Rebekah: I did speak up when you first started cutting my hair; I asked you if you were going to wash or comb my hair to check for length; and you replied “this is the way I cut curly hair, I just see where the curls fall”.\nAbout Cut Cutters, I did mention that I went to Cut Cutters for a hair cut; but that was two months ago and my hair was getting too long at the bangs. I told you that Cut Cutters did a good job with my hair; but now I wanted a hair cut like the picture I showed you, because my hair was looking a little boxing; photo 7 was taken 4 days prior of getting a hair cut from you.\nWhen I left the salon; I did like the hair style; but was not happy that it was not the hair cut or the style I asked for.\nI changed my rating from 3 to 1 star because every time I am around my friends; they asked me who chopped off you hair like that, she must not had like you; and every time I wash my hair; it is very difficult to style my hair with so much uneven hair.\nI didn’t return to Cut Cutters because I wanted the salon experience, and the community that salons offer, and Cut Cutter doesn’t have that.\nI left this review, so other people can read about my experience with you; it may help other people pick hair stylist accordantly to their need. I didn’t call the salon to get it fix, because I will not let you near my hair for a haircut; once you cut off the hair, there is not way to put it back."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipM2p5o4FMl1HcENlJw3RftwHMx199yn-QCzrXrt\u0026fid=0x0:0x5e006fd9e9bf685a""],""When"":""2024-10-22""},{""Name"":""Joelle Rudder"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWyVrj1SzsvzH7klZQJnAUrMVqsSfPAN56GoS83QyHvlDNKrwCL8Q=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Mae Jones is not only a curly hair expert.

I show up, wait an hour, she’s not even there, and I had to have other hairdressers try to contact her because she wasn’t answering back to me. Find out she wanted to reschedule. That’s ok, whatever, she mentions to move the appointment out 4 weeks. 4 weeks pass and I realize I never got an automated appointment notification like I normally do, so I reach out to her in concern and AGAIN she reads my message and ignores it. I’ve been waiting for my hair appointment since NOVEMBER 5th, my last appointment being in September so 3 months now. My roots have grown out, and I was supposed to have my hair done for the holiday season. The staff is friendly and wonderful and helped me out by getting contact with my stylist when I couldn’t, but this is highly unprofessional.

I have spent over $2k and have been seen by 3 different stylists.

However, when I had my hair done at the appointment by Zach, it was done as a full highlight and root melt (which he asked if I wanted, I said yes, but did not know it was an additional cost.) So anyways, it was not what I wanted but I wasn’t aware of this until the end. I even showed Zach photos of how blonde my hair used to be and that was what I wanted it to look like (I’ll attach the photo to the review as well) before hand and showed him that I had a good 4-5 inches of grow out as well. By then end of the session, my hair did not look much different. I wasn’t super happy but thought I would give it a try and even scheduled a follow up session. However, when I got home that evening, I began looking at my hair and lifting up sections and seeing what it looked like and I was baffled at how bad it was. There are huge chunks that weren’t even highlighted and really bad “banding” where the grow out was. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. I did not reach out to the salon for any kind of resolution but found another salon who fixed my hair and cancelled my follow up here. I will not be returning to the Scarlet Salon which is a bummer because their stylists show photos of their work and it looks amazing. Not sure why mine was so bad. I paid $160 for this and then had to pay another $250 a week later to have it try to be corrected  elsewhere."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNywvBwm7q506VvvXxXYNxqJsrrE2jgO3TFkh9r\u0026fid=0x0:0x74ffbe76a447cc5a""],""When"":""2021-6-6""},{""Name"":""Yoanna Orlaie"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVtz4CFAtZ8rl9I2xhDIlklNtNoSaHHZ-FaF_x2Q8eyZDGaUqSo=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Alden gave me my dream highlights!

In NYC, I had the same stylist for 4-5 week color touch ups for more than 6 years.  Therefore,  I was looking for a new salon to call home and my expectations were high.  Babooshka did not disappoint.  I was paired with Nathaniel, a wonderful stylist who really took the time to understand my needs and goals with my color and overall hair.\n\nThe team really took the time and were very thorough. One thing I really appreciated was that the owner checked in often to ensure their process matched the color I already had and kept it as natural as possible.  Additionally, I noticed the same type of detailed, thorough attention for any other customers who came in for a color.  They really know what they're doing.\n\nI've already had two appointments and am scheduled for my third.  I am really happy to call Babooshka my salon in my new home of Denver!\n\nFEB 2020 UPDATE:\n\nI have been faithfully going to Nathaniel at Babooshka for a year and a half now and cannot say enough good things. Nathaniel loves his craft, from the relationship with his client to the technicality/science of his work. He has transformed my hair/look/style from long gold blonde, shoulder length more natural blonde to dark major pixie cut and today, our favorite look, an ash blonde pixie. Wow just wow.

This may be a beautiful salon inside, but it is not a reflection of the quality of their hair . I have been getting hair extensions for four years and the hair that Isal sells and offers is complete garbage! Two sets of hair were completely ruined after just two washes. They first tried to say that maybe the toner was left on too long. Then they tried to say that maybe it was dried incorrectly (should be able to rough dry hair before using round brush) and they said this blew the cuticle after 2 weeks!  All I know is if you are looking for good hair this is not the place. I spent so much money replacing hair here. It is absolutely sad. They also do not stand by their product, so if their hair becomes ruined for no apparent reason after just a few weeks, they will not replace it. The website indicates that their hair is not Remy human hair. I have since moved on to a salon that offers Bello Haven remy human hair extensions and I am happy to report that they are completely different and the best quality! I could say more about this salon, but I am choosing to keep the focus on the horrible hair quality. The image is after 2 washes, all I did was sit in the car to come home from dinner. It also looked like this when I arrived at dinner and had to keep brushing the tangles and matting out throughout my dinner, it was embarrassing. It just clumped into balls constantly,  simply by breathing. My new hair and other hair I have had in the past has NEVER done this, and I rough dry before smoothing. I also want to add that I used all the recommended products and oiled my hair as instructed. I don’t have the money to just not take care of my hair I buy, so I’m very good at doing what’s right to keep it healthy. I also want to add that the first stylist I had indicated other clients were complaining too and they were also dismissed. The new place I go also mentioned that they get a lot of Isla’s dissatisfied clients. Don’t judge a book by it’s cover at Isla, what you see and what you get don’t align."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPTJ1oxbEtAGknBhqy6qf-ReAzqcDmo7c19Jy4H\u0026fid=0x0:0x693d2383e0200309""],""When"":""2024-11-5""},{""Name"":""Molly Matelski"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUtSgzaCECMDEI3pJgXm68kRyvRGfm40ZzdpZKYz30Cfc5lEhWU=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Lacey Ham was my stylist and she is awesome!

I have another appointment to see if she can fix it and can update once done.\n\nThe vibe of the salon is very cool, the decorations are spot on and they keep offering water or drinks to you which is very customer service friendly.

Terrible experience with hair color and huge waste of money. During the color the stylist got the color all over my face. To top that off she made my dark brown hair jet black.\n\nI had to go back again where they attempted to correct their mistake by applying two treatments of Malibu under heat lamps for over an hour. Stylist applied it to grey roots and the rest of the hair all in one sitting which was a mistake! The Malibu barely lifted the black but made my roots orange which I could not see until I got to a place where there was good light. Also the toner they were supposed to apply after Malibu never got done. When I asked stylist if he was going to apply toner, he said no. I trusted him:( After two complete fails I had zero faith in their abilities, want  my money back!\n\nI had to pay ULTA for a toner treatment $90, now I'm going to have to pay a qualified stylist over $400 to get rid of this black hair. Holistic owner is refusing to refund my money. Terrible experience, terrible waste of time, huge wage of money. These stylists are amateurs and liars, they are fake heartless people.\n\nI'm thankful to say that the mistakes this hair salon made with my hair color were corrected by another salon.\n\nMessage to responder below- get your facts straight! Clearly your employees are telling you lies. There was no consultation, your stylist was in a rush for some after work event involving the death of a bar tender from your neighboring business, she never told me she was coloring my hair ash black, never showed me a swatch. She got the color ALL over my face! My plans for after this hair color had to be cancelled because I had to go home and fix the stains all over my face! And you didn't do anything for free. In your  attempt to fix your mistake you created more mistakes! And the reason it took me 50 days to ask for a refund was because my boyfriend was going through chemotherapy and was in the hospital. Otherwise I was feeling so hopeless after what you did to my hair that I gave up. It wasn't until I revisited a former stylist who encouraged me to get the awful ink black hair fixed, that I decided to reach out to ask for a refund. I had no idea an honest business would say no. And what does you being \""women owned\"" have to do with it?! You run your business like a teenager! My mother owned her own salon for 15 years and she was a professional, never treated any customers like you did me! I hope you crash and burn."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPlEYPT0Dkjo3CxOT5AgQmclXzFGMgFNhgMBi9a\u0026fid=0x0:0xa7037fcd4c9a51f1""],""When"":""2023-7-18""},{""Name"":""Madeline Nooney"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUVJTEnm4gzqP8BYn_j-LXCdnsvkDZxJVeWT9v7j4oSozok6UUR=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Sheena is the best!

After having them taken out, my hair looks worse than it did before, so much breakage and unevenly cut from the stylist trying to blend my real hair and the extension hair. I couldn't wear my hair down because it wouldn't blend even when curled, so I had to wear my hair up and strategically place each hair because the glue would peak out. I'm very dissatisfied with this service. I would have hoped that spending so much money would mean higher quality, unfortunately I was wrong.

I showed the hairstylist what I wanted which is basically a trim of what I already had. I showed how short I wanted to cut off which was about 3 inches when I'm standing up.  Then I sat down, he measured my hair based on a layer that I had in the front and did a rough cut that took off 6+ inches of hair. On top of that, he was telling me a story about how he made another client cry because he chopped off her hair to donate to charity but cut it too short. Long and behold, it happened to me. What was supposed to be a trim with face framing layers ended up becoming a long bob. My hair is so uneven that I need to go to a different salon to fix it. I have attached photos of my hair before, what I was aiming for and what I ended up with. If you're looking for a salon who completely disregards your requests, then this is the place. I reached out to management to get a refund and they offered to give me a complimentary appointment. After what I went through, I would never ever let them touch my hair ever again.

There’s no longer a receptionist to schedule appointments. There’s no online booking system, so you’re left to exchange a series of texts with your stylist in an attempt to divine their schedule. There’s no comfortable waiting area. And since the stylists hang out in a back room with no view of the front of the salon, you’re likely to walk in and wait with no acknowledgment of your arrival. While I’ve always liked the quality of the haircuts I’ve gotten, I think it’s time to move on to somewhere with actual management that’s dedicated to providing a better customer experience."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Kim Knowles"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXVDyApBkmgx3Vt7Ur9hpRONVO2_PPK7UCpRE6OPpRQ5wJKCiiw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Jessica Blair is amazing.

I've used her ~5 times and its been an issue every time. She is anywhere from 10-35 min late starting my hair every time but the one time i was a few minutes late from work I was text shamed. I had my 40th bday trip booked and a hair appt scheduled 10 weeks in advance and she text me asking to cancel and move it. I was of course a little disappointed as that gave me next to no time to pivot and her response was not one of being sorry for the inconvenience to ME. It was \""I was hoping to see my sister for the first time since Covid, sorry thats an inconvenience to you\"". Like, wow. Really crushing the running a business and putting your clients first thing. One time my highlights we so bad I had to come in and get them fixed. She handles multiple clients at once so be prepared for a 3 hour experience and mistakes to happen. And my initial appt was a partial highlight and cut... a few appts in my price went up dramatically and i never said anything and i just walked out like \""did I just get scammed?\"" Then went back to the regular cost then went up again! When i asked her about it she says she did a full highlight on me. She says she makes the judgement call of what i need and just does it. yeah ok... because thats how this should work...wouldn't you confirm with your client before doing something they didn't book?  The icing on the cake for me was when i was getting engaged and texted her 4 weeks ago if she could get me in early and I never heard a peep back. Today she messaged me asking if i was on my way for my appt, which admittedly was my fault as i didn't put it in my calendar but i was trying to confirm with her when it was and to get in early. Again, my fault - mistakes happen as she should be WELL aware of since most of them come from her side. When I said it looks like we both missed texts from each other her response was \"" i guess you should find someone else to do you hair\"".
