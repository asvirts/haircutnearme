The atmosphere is relaxed and the facilities are bright and clean.  It's a masculine environment like old-time barber shops, but I think women are welcome too.  Booking an appointment online is simple and reliable.  I used to get my hair cut maybe once a year.  The way I like to keep my hair is somewhat out of the ordinary, but all I had to do was tell Kevin one thing about it and he instinctively knew what I wanted.  Perfect haircut for me.  I will definitely be back.",

The price is actually pretty good for how well they do, most other places I've been offering similar services are 10 bucks more at least.\n\nThis is not a place that you can in and out real quick (unless maybe you request it) but that's not a knock against them. The barbers take their time to make sure your hair is right and looks good",

It's the kind of place that doesn't need a computer to remember what type of haircut you like. I will say that the only downfall(?) is that you would be wise to make an appointment, but that's only if you are used to places in the shopping mall that jack your dome up. Good haircuts take time and once people get one from Kev's, they keep coming back.",

However, I recently had a severe Lupus flare up and my hair began to fall out. All I was hoping for was a simple tapered fade and line up. I wanted to look fresh and feel positive about my hair again without always wearing bandanas. Instead, my name remained on the walk-in list as other walk-ins came in and were called before me. It is very disappointing and discouraging.",

With the newfound freedom to choose his own style, he found himself a bit overwhelmed about what he truly wanted. After countless shops, we decided to visit Exclusive Experience in hopes of finding a haircut that would reflect his personality and suit his frame. Initially, we were a bit skeptical, but that doubt quickly vanished when we witnessed Ebony's genuine passion for providing exceptional customer service as well as haircuts. Ebony took the time, guiding my son through the process of selecting HIS PERFECT HAIRCUT. He left the shop with a beaming smile and a newfound confidence! It was absolutely worth stepping out of our comfort zone. I wholeheartedly recommend Ebony if you're looking for astonishing results and top quality service üëå",

Being of mixed race it was hard finding someone a place that can work with my hair texture and I found just that. Not to mention the amazing designs I get from them too especially from my barber AL. AL will give you a phenomenal haircut that will make you feel brand new. Can get anything from a simple lineup to a full on fade, lineup, hot towel, face lineup, and he‚Äôs really good with designs!! You‚Äôd think you‚Äôd have to spend +$100 for the treatment you‚Äôre getting but it‚Äôs really affordable. Go check them out and especially book an appointment with AL, they‚Äôll get you right.",

          "Description": "I recently had a disappointing experience with the SMP service that I cannot recommend. Initially, I was excited based on the consultations and promises made, but unfortunately, the outcome did not match my expectations.\n\nThe results were uneven and lacked the realism I was promised. Despite my attempts to communicate my concerns, I was assured that my results would look natural with my hair length (a 1-2, short but not shaved). However, after two sessions, it became clear that it would only look natural with a shaved head. My feedback was not taken seriously, and little effort was made to rectify the situation in a timely manner. I had a formal event two weeks later and was told my SMP would be undetectable by then, but that wasn't the case. I was advised to use hair fibers as a solution instead.\n\nThe lack of support and communication left me feeling disheartened, especially after investing time and money. A service should stand by its results, particularly when they are permanent, and in this case, it did not.\n\nI urge others to carefully consider their options before committing to this SMP service, as no one deserves to feel self-conscious or embarrassed about their appearance. Thankfully, I was able to get a partial refund, but the pricing for this service is steep for the results I received. Every knowledgeable source I've spoken to has agreed that my experience with this practitioner was borderline unethical. Time to explore laser options..",

Dawson informed me he wasn't sure how well my hair would style that way and gave me some great suggestions if I wanted to play it safe, which i really appreciated. I decided on my original idea and he did a great job on the whole cut.

He took his time to blend every single detail, checking with me with everything he did every step of the way to make sure he was getting everything perfect. A master at his craft, watching him cut is like watching the pros on YouTube and saying ‚ÄúI wish I could find a barber like that‚Äù‚Ä¶ Alejandro is that guy.

          "Description": "I thought hard about what star to give honestly I give it 1/2 a star because I called twice spoke with someone explained that I been going to the same barber 15yrs and he's out of town for 6 weeks it's weeks 3 1/2 a what can I say I feel good with a fresh cut. I told them I looked at the pictures on Google and on their Facebook page and I would like to get my Hair cut showed them several pictures of how I just get my hair cut short all even because I have waves and I get a light taper in the back and usually a small design he had ample fuc..n opportunity to say sorry I'm booked or gave me the option to getting a hair cut by someone in training or someone fresh on the floor and not 3 mention it was only 2 barbers in the shop. Sorry but not sorry I don't want to be nobody's experiment client I just said don't do the design and kinda ended my hair and politely paid him more than I would even pay my barber because I was debating my tip by how decent my hair would be. No kidding I could have did this to my own hair and I enjoy getting my hair because I like a good shave and shaping of my goe-t and beard. My conclusion is from my own experience that few spanish barber can cut blk ppl hair and it might be because their hair texture is similar to WHT ppl hair idk that's my opinion. And I'm also sure in the years to come the newish barber there be turn out to be an excellent barber but I don't have time for mess ups so I need hands with yearsss of experience in my head I needed the barber that cut the hair in the Facebook pictures to cut my hair but maybe he focus on his regular customers which is fine but he should have just told me no when I called.  This is a picture of my normal hair cut I get from my barber I would have been pleased with just the even trim a light fade in the back and a razor line that looks razor straight and what I got was anything and everything I didn't want.the 2nd Pic if from what your shop did the lining is so off",

I was told to head over in about 15 minutes. I explained I can be there in less than 10 since I work off the through-way. He said fine just head over. This was right around 2:30pm. I get there and he's cutting Someones hair so I sit down. After about 25 minutes or so the cut is done. The barber calls someone else to the chair. I wait until about 3:55pm to ask when they close and to explain I'm leaving due to me being 10 minutes past my lunch break hour. The barber tried to sat \"my bad\" and explain he still has that 3:45pm appointment as if I was gonna be waiting behind a 3rd person to get a hair cut. This was a absolute waste of my time and lunch break. Why even tell me to come if you had that many people waiting. The other barber in there was cutting the same person's hair for the entire time i was there so this place seemed extremely unprofessional to me. I won't be going back.",

I walked in right after a rush and got my third haircut from him.\nDonovan asked my preferences and then gave me a professional and unhurried haircut. Very affordable too!\nDuring our conversation it was obvious that Donovan has the best interests of the business at heart.  He is very interested in making each customer happy and has introduced Google  Reviews by to the process. He knows each day how many people give reviews and where the shop stands in the eyes of the reviewer.\nI‚Äôll be back to Blackie‚Äôs for  my next haircut.",

With the newfound freedom to choose his own style, he found himself a bit overwhelmed about what he truly wanted. After countless shops, we decided to visit Exclusive Experience in hopes of finding a haircut that would reflect his personality and suit his frame. Initially, we were a bit skeptical, but that doubt quickly vanished when we witnessed Ebony's genuine passion for providing exceptional customer service as well as haircuts. Ebony took the time, guiding my son through the process of selecting HIS PERFECT HAIRCUT. He left the shop with a beaming smile and a newfound confidence! It was absolutely worth stepping out of our comfort zone. I wholeheartedly recommend Ebony if you're looking for astonishing results and top quality service üëå",

Being of mixed race it was hard finding someone a place that can work with my hair texture and I found just that. Not to mention the amazing designs I get from them too especially from my barber AL. AL will give you a phenomenal haircut that will make you feel brand new. Can get anything from a simple lineup to a full on fade, lineup, hot towel, face lineup, and he‚Äôs really good with designs!! You‚Äôd think you‚Äôd have to spend +$100 for the treatment you‚Äôre getting but it‚Äôs really affordable. Go check them out and especially book an appointment with AL, they‚Äôll get you right.",

          "Description": "I recently had a disappointing experience with the SMP service that I cannot recommend. Initially, I was excited based on the consultations and promises made, but unfortunately, the outcome did not match my expectations.\n\nThe results were uneven and lacked the realism I was promised. Despite my attempts to communicate my concerns, I was assured that my results would look natural with my hair length (a 1-2, short but not shaved). However, after two sessions, it became clear that it would only look natural with a shaved head. My feedback was not taken seriously, and little effort was made to rectify the situation in a timely manner. I had a formal event two weeks later and was told my SMP would be undetectable by then, but that wasn't the case. I was advised to use hair fibers as a solution instead.\n\nThe lack of support and communication left me feeling disheartened, especially after investing time and money. A service should stand by its results, particularly when they are permanent, and in this case, it did not.\n\nI urge others to carefully consider their options before committing to this SMP service, as no one deserves to feel self-conscious or embarrassed about their appearance. Thankfully, I was able to get a partial refund, but the pricing for this service is steep for the results I received. Every knowledgeable source I've spoken to has agreed that my experience with this practitioner was borderline unethical. Time to explore laser options..",

Their was only one price option which was $30; When advising it was for a kid, they said it would be $28. Both boys (each with a different stylist) needed correction on how to cut (or what to fix) after the haircut was \"complete\". One guy had to call another female over because he had no idea how to fix the issue I was showing him. It was almost as though they weren't fully trained when they were hired or never passed cosmetology school. Then they weren't going to wash their hair which I was told was included with the price. After insisting they was their hair for $28, they did.  After leaving I still had to go home and make some minor trim corrections to each of them. Overall, it was overpriced, not good service, and I had to come home and correct their mistakes. I would highly recommend going some where else.",

I have a 4-year old toddler son and I haven't brought him in a hair salon because he's deathly afraid of the buzzing sound. For a year, I gave my son bowl cuts, and his family photos looked cute and goofy but it is what it is. I gave SportClips a try, and I'm sure glad I did. I kept my fingers crossed, because he cried the whole time, but he stayed still which was remarkable. The hairdresser was very patient and gentle, she was very understanding, and she consoled him the entire time. She is a mother of 2 herself. I love that SportClips is family-oriented and caters to the age of their client. 10/10 and highly recommend!",

I love the fact that when you book on the site it shows the amount of time it will take for your service and when you book your appointment is paid for in full. (Was able to pay via cc so EXTRA plus) Everyone in the shop is friendly and professional. Will definitely be returning and referring others as well.",

From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was inviting and energetic, perfectly reflecting the sports theme. The staff was friendly and professional, making me feel right at home.\n\nMy stylist took the time to understand exactly what I wanted and offered great suggestions tailored to my hair type. The haircut was precise, and I appreciated the attention to detail. I also enjoyed the MVP experience, which included a relaxing shampoo and scalp massage‚Äîan absolute treat after a long week!\n\nThe salon was clean and well-organized, which added to the overall positive vibe. Plus, being able to catch some sports highlights on TV while getting my haircut was a nice touch.\n\nI highly recommend Sports Clips to anyone looking for a quality haircut in a fun environment. I‚Äôll definitely be back for my next trim!",

Extremely disappointed.\n\nEdit: updated my review to three stars instead of one. It essentially was a snafu with the booking website. No fault of the owner, but still not my fault either. I do have to give him credit and say that when I got in touch with him he took the time to talk with me, and made every effort to make things right.\n\nEnded up finding a barbershop much closer to home. But based off of his response to the difficult situation, I would definitely recommend him to others.",

          "Description": "This is a top notch place to get your haircut and/or beard trimmed. I walked in on Friday and didn't have an appointment but Ben was able to seat me. I got a haircut (bald mid drop fade) and a beard trim, and Ben killed it!\n\nI am very particular about my beard and hair, as well as The Barber I approve of cutting and trimming said hair, so I spoke with him about my expectations and asked if he was capable of handling the task, he said yes. He was very confident in his ability and went right to work. The end result was phenomenal and this guy truly knows the art of barbering.\n\nI highly recommend South Beards and Blades Grooming Lounge. The staff were friendly, the environment was nice, the treatment and services were exceptional, and the location is perfect.\n\nThank you Ben, and thank you Southern Beards and Blades for offering such a premium experience in this industry! God bless!",

Takes his other barbers time to cut his beard while their customers wait. Call to talk to his barbers working under his shop and he says it's his business. Good luck running a business you don't care about your employee's. I wouldn't work for someone like you",

Tyler Paul was my barber and he did such a great job on my haircut that I decided to return 3 days later for a beard trim, both of which I am 100% satisfied with.\n\nAlso their website is very user friendly and allows you to schedule your appointment with a few clicks of your mouse. I will be a return customer and you would be doing yourself a disservice it you didn't go and check them out. If you are looking for an excellent barber shop then look no further. Their excellent ratings speak for themselves.",

I recently moved to Lafayette and was in search of a good hairstylist, as I had gone to the same person for years prior. I'm pretty picky about my cuts and it's always hard to find someone that does exactly what I'm hoping for. I'm so happy I found someone I like. She's great with long hair (which I have) and listens to what you want. I highly recommend her especially if you are like me worry about someone messing up your long hair.",

Light skin guy makes no conversation, ask what I want, show picture to him. He literally did nothing like the picture then pushed my hairline back. I literately wasted 25 dollars. One and done never going back, not even in desperate need.",

          "Description": "I recently had the pleasure of getting my dreadlocks interlocked by Madison, and I can confidently say that she is a true professional in every sense of the word. From the moment I walked into the salon, I was greeted with warmth and enthusiasm, which immediately put me at ease. Especially seeing a Bob Marley Poster and vinyl records paint the walls.\n\nMadison‚Äôs expertise in interlocking is evident; she took her time to explain the process in detail, ensuring I was comfortable every step of the way. Her meticulous approach and keen eye for detail made me feel confident that my hair was in the best hands. She not only applied her skills with precision but also shared valuable tips on maintenance and care tailored specifically to my hair type. (4C)\n\nWhat truly sets Madison apart is her ability to inspire and motivate her clients. Throughout the appointment, she encouraged me with positive affirmations about my hair journey and offered insightful advice on how to embrace my dreadlocks fully. I felt empowered by her words, realizing that this hairstyle is not just a trend but a true expression of my individuality.\n\nMadison's passion for her craft shines through in her work. The finished product exceeded my expectations; my dreadlocks look absolutely stunning and are incredibly well-structured. I left the salon feeling rejuvenated and excited about my hair journey, equipped with the knowledge and confidence to maintain my new look.\n\nIf you're considering dreadlocks or interlocking, I wholeheartedly recommend Madison. Her professionalism, expertise, and uplifting spirit make the entire experience not only enjoyable but also transformative. You won‚Äôt just leave with beautiful hair; you‚Äôll leave feeling inspired and motivated to embrace your unique style! Thank you",

          "Description": "Absolutely not, went to this hairdresser about 6 years and the owner was recommended by a co worker at the time. I traveled about a hour and half to get my hair done and every time were going I had a decent experience.  At the time the salon was set up that you got braided down for the sew-in then you went upstairs to get the hair to get sewn-in. This particular day the owner felt generous and gave the customer a free charge for her instillation while I had to pay. I know a owner can do what they want charge whatever but the way it was done and it was done based on a colorist stand point.  I wasn't as knowledgeable about taking taking care of a closure or frontal and I didn't realize that the closure had a bald spot , I was told a price and I thought it wasn't a favor and I didn't buy it, nor I didn't get a discount on the closure with that blatant display of favoritism.  I refused to pay for a closure for 400 dollars when I can buy bundles and closure from Amazon for way less, much less a couple times over.  I told the owner to make bald closure work.  I felt as though by her charging me the 400 for the closure was to make up the difference of the free sew-in of the new client sitting across me.  I promise I never go back!\nUpdate   1/13/24\nThe owner posted and said she didn't try to charge me a 400 closure, lie- hit dogs holler, and don't try try to get the good Lord's name in this (reap what I sow so laughable)...but you didn't address the colorism issue. Every since I had that bad experience from the owner I have talked to people who no longer go there. Do Better!  I am not changing this review, nor am I going back and forth its been 6 years-REALLY?????????????????  AGAIN  NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

          "Description": "I loved Maddie! I am an autistic woman and I have sensory processing disorder. Washing my hair and getting hair cuts are so hard for me. I came sort of close to close because I knew not a lot of other people would be there. Maddie was so kind and gave me an extra towel for the water I was concerned about splashing my face. Y‚Äôall, this is enough to make an autistic person go home and have an entire meltdown about. Most autistic women mask through this experience but I have been on a journey of unmasking. Maddie doesn‚Äôt realize it but she helped me step closer into who I actual am that day by finding my voice and having the courage to ask for an extra towel. I have been met with unkindness every single time in my life before this salon. It has given me a seriously hard time taking care of my hair and going to salons to learn about my hair type-I was raised outside of my family and have a different hair type than the woman who raised me. Maddie meeting me with kindness and an extra towel was literally a life changing moment and it is like that for autistic people all over. Maddie washed my hair, was so thoughtful with the lighting and displayed preexisting knowledge of sensory disorders. I could have cried. We talked a lot about her beautiful baby while she very carefully cut my hair. She checked in to make sure I was comfortable every step of the way, and in the end, everyone in the salon couldn‚Äôt help but express how cute my hair was‚Ä¶but we weren‚Äôt even done. When I told Maddie about not understanding my hair type she asked me about it. I have naturally curly hair but have always treated it like it was pin straight. Maddie and I talked a bit about how to treat it and she used this beautiful smelling product that made my curls bounce. I will be returning to her and bringing my entire family. I will also be recommending her to everyone in the neurodivergent community. I am actually a leader and online influencer/educator for the ND community and am excited to recommend Maddie and this salon to local ND families. Thank you Maddie. Your kindness was life changing.",

She knew it was a mess up because she so nicely took $5 bucks off my bill. I had to make an appointment with someone else to fix this mess. It is so short now I don‚Äôt know how anyone can fix it.

          "Description": "This barber shop is top notch! Lyle has been cutting my hair for the last several months and he is a great barber. A few times I have been out of town and not able to come to him and this shop and regretted it each time. He does my beard and does a fabulous job. Very detailed oriented, friendly, and professional. The vibe in the shop is very positive and friendly. I also have to say his line of products is amazing . The beard oil he has is top notch. Don‚Äôt miss out on this experience. My warning is- once you go here, you will never want to go to another place . Great place for a good relaxing cut, beard shave and just hanging out ! Highly recommend! I live 40 minutes from here and drive by probably 40/50 shops to get here . It‚Äôs a notch above the rest I can assure you. The online scheduling is easy and everything about the place is right on ! Even have someone who does an amazing job shining shoes and boots . He did some magic on some boots I was about ready to retire . Full service Top notch Barber shop with class and real genuine people here . Thanks Lyle for the great work and shop and for establishing a wonderful cohesive staff of elite barbers. I‚Äôd challenge anyone to just try it once if you never have !!!",

I‚Äôve been living in Lafayette for a year and tried out several barbers before finding Lyle at Acadiana Barber Co, and I will not be going anywhere else from now on. Lyle is a very detailed and professional barber; he just knows how to give a good haircut. He and his crew are also just straight up pleasant to be around, always leave in a good mood with a good cut. Thanks guys you‚Äôre the best!",

The entire process was smooth, from the relaxing hot towel on my face to the shampoo and conditioner treatment. Hawk was skilled, friendly, and efficient.

However after many months of membership, I've learned that this establishment is what happens when capitalism meets barbershops. Good barbers are totally overworked, rushed, and constantly behind schedule. Many times I had to concede the shampoo job I paid for with my membership because I had to help the barbers get back on schedule. I'd like a refund for some of the monthly membership. It's 6pm and I'm still waiting a 530 appointment and don't think I'll get a shampoo today üò£üëéüèº",

          "Description": "The vibe is nice. The stylist Hawk, however, was very standoffish. After sitting me down he asked me what I'd like. I described my usual cut, and he retorted that it was not possible (simply wanted a fade but one part to hang over like an undercut). I've gotten it countless times and even showed a photo to demonstrate what I meant. I admit I'm not a hairdresser and I don't know all the jargon but I'm pretty sure a reasonable person would understand or try and walk through what would be best. Instead he made it an ultimatum between a fade and an undercut. I chose the fade and he even got combative about the clipper size (asked for a fade from size 1 guard to size 3 which as far as I know is relatively normal). Meanwhile, everyone around me was vibing and it seemed like everyone else was able to get a proper and polite consultation from their hairdresser. The cut ended up being fine, but I could easily get a much better cut for the same price elsewhere (probably without the extra towel, shampoo, and drink though). It was the towel, shampoo, and drink that were actually the enjoyable parts of the experience. Shout-out to the bartender she was very kind. All in all, I think if you book anyone but Hawk you might have a good time. I didn't.",

However, upon arrival, I was informed that he wasn‚Äôt available and that another barber would take my appointment instead‚Äîwithout any prior notice. First red flag.\n\nWhile the barber who cut my hair was kind, he clearly lacked the skills and technique of a modern barber. His tools were subpar, leaving me with multiple cuts and nicks around my head and ears. To make matters worse, my haircut was so uneven that I had to visit another barber to fix it.\n\nThis review is mainly for Julian: If you‚Äôre going to accept appointments, honor them. If you value your customers, respect their time. Otherwise, don‚Äôt bother taking bookings at all.",

I asked for a fade and both sides look different from each other, barber left uneven patches of hair all over and he got mad when I pointed out that it wasn‚Äôt even. To fix it, he just cut all the hair on the side at one level instead of fading it.\n\nI‚Äôm increasing my rating to 3 starts because the owner contacted and offer a refund. However, I‚Äôm still left with a bad hair cut until my hair grows back.",

I have a little loan ranges all over my head that are uneven that I had to go back and clip myself or trim with shears. he wasn‚Äôt really holding the clippers against my head, so I‚Äôm not surprised that I‚Äôm covered and little hairs that didn‚Äôt get cut. On more than one occasion while he was using the clippers on my head, he was looking at other people in the salon instead of at my head and now I have to fix the haircut in my bathroom mirror.",

Despite this, I was charged a no-show fee of $190!!! To make matters worse, they charged a card that I never even put on file with them.\n\nThis kind of shady practice is unacceptable. It seems like they are more interested in finding ways to take your money rather than providing good service. When I called to resolve the issue, I was met with unhelpful and rude staff who refused to acknowledge their mistake.\n\nI highly recommend avoiding this place.

I'm not sure what his name was, but he did not cut my beard right at all.\nI put notes in my appointment info hoping that might clear up any issue. My haircut was fine, but I asked that he just clean up my beard a little bit, cut the small hairs that were popping out here and there, and then shave my neck and back of my neck with a hot lather. He thinned my beard a lot, pulled up my neck line rather than just clean it up and then used a razor box to scour my neck clean using only powder to lubricate and protect my skin (which it did not).\nThe only time he turned me toward the mirror during the entire service was once things were done, and he even left a bald patch under my chin.\nI may return to see Henry, but in general I don't think I'll be patronizing this business again.",

I had just got back from a hair transplant operation (2-month mark), and communicated to the barber that I have a scar that he has to be aware of when cutting (hence the low fade). I showed a video of the cut I got from my former barber for additional clarity. The barber completely ignored my instruction and gave me a high bald fade that STARTS at the scar. He cut my hair too short and the scar is extremely conspicuous. The hair will grow back but this barber is unskillful and it looks like my search for a new barber will continue. Attached are photos of what I asked for and what I got",

Asked for a trim up around my cheeks and jowl on a 3-4 inch beard. Before I could say stop he shaved off my half my face at a half inch. I said that's not what I asked for. He just said everyone gets a number 5 trimmer. He said it would grow back fast. Also trimed top third of my mustache unsolicited after that. Lined up my cheeks on top way too low as well. Sport clips level skill for 110 bucks. 2 stars instead of one because i asked him to go back and fix several problems with the haircut and he did.",

They noticed there were mostly kids so they put on the Lion King. I was taking my friend's son. I think she would go back.",

The staff is very unprofessional, they keep you waiting while they play video games, leaving the shop while you‚Äôre waiting on them and don‚Äôt let you know that they are returning or not. I visited the shop back in 2011 and the service was the same then. I decided to give them a second try today and sadly the staff is still the same with new barbers. I would not recommend them to anyone even if they don‚Äôt have an option, I would tell anyone it‚Äôs better to do without a haircut than going to Edges Barber shop on U St NW.",

Great conversation amazing customer service and excellent haircut 5 out of 5. I have not had a haircut this sharp since way before COVID. He's a true artist who takes his time and makes you feel at home. Good atmosphere good music great people keep DC alive and strong by supporting amazing black owned businesses. This is a local gem!

I get very nervous trying out new barbers, but Daniel surpassed my expectations. Not only is he a great barber, he's a funny guy and his smile lights up the room. Does a good job on fades; he's detailed; and you feel taken cared of the entire time. No rush, he's a perfectionist. Go see him and level up.",

          "Description": "They saved me!\n\nI went to a different place earlier in the day that ended up butchering my hair; what was supposed to be a mid-fade in the worst way possible. I walked in there after looking online for a place to salvage what was left of my hair, in hopes they could fix it, first looking at the cuts they were performing of course. Everyone looked sharp, the customers looked happy and the hair cuts were professional. I asked if they could take me in last minute to help me adjust what had gone horribly wrong a few hours before, and they did! All this on a Sunday before they closed.\n\nQuynh took me in and fixed the botch job that was done to me the best she could. I am not going to post a photo because it wouldn't represent her normal work, but I have to say I am far less embarrassed now to show my hair and not hide it under a hat, no longer having a unblended fade with a high top hairstyle. She was able to line up the fade lines, blend them in, carefully cutting the top part of my hair to make more sense of it all, and finish off the scattered hairs that were missed on the 'skin' part of the cut.\n\nI thank her very much for this! I am sure in a few days once the high fade grows in a bit it will look spectacular, like the mid-fade it should have been originally.",

          "Description": "Haircut was on 7/22/23, price for men‚Äôs was $30 before tipping. Haircut was good enough to look presentable but it wasn‚Äôt what I was thinking. Do keep in mind, I have longer hair for a dude. I‚Äôd rate it a 3.5.\n\nMy barber‚Äôs English was okay, but not fully conversational. He got the basic instructions I asked for when I used the appropriate lingo (ex. give me face framing layers), but thinned my hair without asking me, which is a red flag of mine. He was a very kind guy though and did the job well and quickly. I would be willing to give this place another shot if it had a lower price tag and more accurate service to what I wanted, but it wasn‚Äôt a bad haircut by any means. Just not quite on target for what I wanted. However, for the lady with shorter hair that got hers cut by the female stylist, it looked amazing. So perhaps this place is just better for shorter hair!",

Celso hit my beard with the clippers and reduced it down to almost nothing in the front, and left a long, full neckbeard that I had to trim on my own after got home to even things out. I'll definitely never be returning, outside of when I go back tomorrow to request a refund.",

I made an appointment for a haircut here specifically for that reason. Upon arrival, I was none too pleased to find a sign on the wall that claimed the price of a haircut is $50. I brought this up with the barber, who told me nothing more than this is the first he's heard of the price discrepancy. I agreed to proceed with the service anyway, to my regret -- the barber did a worse job than barbers who have cut my hair for $20. They've really got some gall charging $50 for that lackluster level of engagement and performance. I will not be returning.",

          "Description": "A couple of my friends and I went there last Wednesday for their speakeasy bar. The speakeasy is beautiful with comfortable seating, especially the booth areas.\n\nWe ordered two rounds of drinks which started at $18. I appreciated that the menu stated the vibes for each drink which made it easy to find the best option. If you do not like any of the pre-constructed cocktails, you can describe what you‚Äôre interested in and they‚Äôll make you a drink. My friend did this option with a mocktail since there weren‚Äôt any on the menu.\n\nThe drinks were beautiful and yummy.\n\nIt appeared that our server was also the bartender and maintained the entire speakeasy by herself. We didn‚Äôt mind that it took a little more time to come around and get our drinks. We were taking our time as well. When our first round of drinks came out we asked for our waters that we had yet to receive. The staff member was rude and dismissive.

We didn‚Äôt have a reservation but there was space at the bar for us. LA and Jeffrey took great care of us. They were friendly and fun. They introduced us to new liquors and let us try some other drinks they were making. I will definitely be back to experience the coffee bar and visit the speakeasy again. Must try!",

After 22 years of having locs, I signed up for a Big Chop appointment to cut them off. First, since I was nervous I sent a text message and Lesley called me to talk me through the process and set expectations for what I might look like after. Then when I got to the appointment, Renah took amazing care of me. She was so positive throughout the experience, remarking on how good and healthy my hair looked and how much I'll be able to do with it as it grows out. She gave me a fabulous short cut, and she took the time to show me the products and tools I can use to achieve a nice curl.  This wasn't just about the cut (although really, I am so pleased with the look), it was about how taken care of I felt throughout the whole experience. I walked out feeling beautiful in more ways than one. Thank you! I'll be back!!",

I tried to tell the barber but he told me to put pomade on it to cover it up.\nHairs were all different lengths and required me to go back in for them to fix it the next day.\nOverall was not a great experience.

This is NOT a chop shop.\nI am Asian but spent most of my life in Latin America and speak Spanish. I‚Äôm used to the collegial Latin atmosphere but I do not feel that the shop feels intimidating or not welcoming to non-Latinos.\nIt‚Äôs great to be in a nice, clean neighborhood barbershop. These guys care about taking care of the place, keep a friendly but courteous atmosphere, and for me most important- these guys all have red sharps containers at their stations so that they change out razor blades each time and dispose of them properly.\nAfter 10 years rotating barber shops, I found my place.",

The man who cut my hair asked what I wanted and I told him long on top with shaved sides and a hard part. The trimmers he uses left my head bleeding. A man selling marijuana came in while I was getting my hair cut and was trying to offer it to the employees. After my hair was butchered I was told it's a flat rate of 50$ a haircut and being who I am I tipped 10$ totaling 60$. Since my haircut I have been told by three other customers that have gone there they were all charged the same flat rate of 25$. Why was I being overcharged for my haircut when three black customers I talked to got charged equally 25$? I don't want to play the race card but I definitely feel it was a factor in being overcharged for a bad hair cut experience. If not because I'm white I feel the man selling marijuana was an influence on being overcharged. All in all the experience was horrible and I don't recommend them to anyone.",

Mohamed is very good at what he does and quickly learns and remembers all of your preferences.  Other barber shops are totally inconsistent and their rates can be ridiculous.  Mohamed's shop is better in every way, period!  Note his change in hours.  If he is ever on vacation, my hair is on vacation, until he returns.  Not wasting my time elsewhere any more!",

But, Muhamed finally opened his door again. You have no idea how happy I was few days ago when I went there. After months trying different barber shop or hair salon in DC, even VA, it's just nothing like the way Mohamed does to my hair. I can see that Mohamed barber shop is practicing social distancing very well in the shop by having a sanitizing machine for his hair cut tools and putting a safe distance between guest waiting seat. Also, Mohamed work by himself and the place is big enough that I think it's very safe. Need to remind you as well that it's Cash only people!\nI've been to Muhammad's place for 12 years!",

I have very thick hair and I have a hard time articulating myself when I want a haircut. Like all the other reviews, it‚Äôs just him cutting hair, so you will probably have to wait if you‚Äôre just getting off a 9-5. The wait is worth it though. I normally walk out of a barber shop with a very choppy cut or a pompadour that I didn‚Äôt want. Mohammad also checked in with me through multiple steps of the cut to make sure I was getting what I wanted, which made me feel valued.\nHe just played his own music & chopped on. Will for sure go back again.",

I highly recommend my artist, his name is Marcelo. He is a very talented stylist. He knows what kind of haircut you need, just by looking at you. I recommend him to all my friends.

          "Description": "I recently had the pleasure of visiting Lee‚Äôs Barbershop in SE, Washington, DC, and I must say, it was an experience that far exceeded my expectations. Founded in 1986, this shop isn‚Äôt just a place to get a haircut‚Äîit‚Äôs a cornerstone of the community.\n\nI was fortunate enough to have Mr. Lee himself as my barber. His kindness and deep knowledge of his craft were immediately apparent. Not only did he give me an incredible haircut‚Äîsharp, crisp, and exactly what I wanted‚Äîbut he also took the time to mentor an apprentice during my visit. The conversation between Mr. Lee and his apprentice was inspiring; he wasn‚Äôt just teaching the art of cutting hair, but also imparting valuable life lessons that will undoubtedly benefit the apprentice for years to come. It was a powerful reminder of how barbershops used to be community hubs, where wisdom was shared just as freely as conversation.\n\nAs I looked around, I saw that all the barbers in the shop were highly skilled and passionate about their work. It‚Äôs clear that this is more than just a job for them‚Äîit‚Äôs a craft they take pride in, and it shows in the results. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a fresh fade, a classic cut, or anything in between, this is the place to go.\n\nLee‚Äôs Barbershop is located in Southeast DC, in a very safe and welcoming area. They accept walk-ins, but I recommend calling ahead to make an appointment, as their popularity is well-deserved.\n\nI will absolutely be a customer for life and highly recommend Lee‚Äôs Barbershop to anyone seeking not just a haircut, but a genuine, community-driven experience.\n\nTrust me‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be disappointed!",

He was attentive and patient with what I needed.  Sometimes as a woman it is a bit intimidating at first to go into a barbershop, but I felt completely comfortable and am grateful for the experience.

As a mother with a son on the autism spectrum, finding a barber who possesses the patience and understanding required is often a challenging task. However, Jay exceeded all expectations and showcased an exceptional level of professionalism and care during our recent visit.\n\nDuring the haircut, my son struggled to stay still. However, Jay's was exceptionally patience. Upon completion, Jay had exerted so much effort that he was visibly sweating, as if he had just finished a rigorous workout. This level of dedication was a testament to his genuine care for his clients and his commitment to delivering an exceptional work.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart. Your understanding and professionalism are commendable. And if yall have the opportunity to visit Lee's Barbershop and experience Jay's expertise firsthand, I highly encourage you to show your appreciation by paying him double for his services.\n\nWith sincere appreciation,\nA Grateful Mom",

Tina usually cuts my hair, but often Minh will take me, or sometimes Harris. I have never met three more hard working people. Their primary concern is the satisfaction of their customers. I always, without fail, leave with an awesome haircut. After you see the same barber after a while, they get to know your style, so I can always walk in and sit down in a chair and they all know exactly what to do. However, it's also great to see new customers walk in for a haircut and be so pleased with how it looks. Tina and Minh run a good business; they are conscientious, respectful, clean, and caring. I have found my permanent barber shop with them!",

So careful of all the small details, and I think this is the coolest haircut I've gotten in years.\n\nGreat price so make sure to tip her well! She really takes her time to make sure you are happy. Also not too much chit-chat since she was super focused on making sure she made everything perfect.

The older guy in like the 4th chair doesn't know what a medium skin fade with finger length hair on top is. If it sounds boring, it's because it is. I'm about as vanilla as they come. He was using scissors instead of clippers for a skin fade... Wow! I asked him to fix it and he clearly didn't know what to do... I felt so bad for him I still tipped like 5$.

The very skilled stylists all take meticulous care to please customers and are very courteous.  I saw the review by glam girl that only Latinx clients were welcome.  I have recently recommended Alex's to African-American friends and I asked the salon about Glam girl's review. I was told that her review was 3 years old, that the salon personnel were different now, and that Alex's was glad to have a diverse clientele.  They did not dismiss, as I did not, the discrimination experienced by Glam girl.",

He did NOT know how to cut long layered hair for men. He chopped and butchered my husbands hair with a razor. We sat there after his appointment waiting to get it fixed but ended up walking away because we witnessed the barber butcher another mans long hair in front of us. did not want to risk ruining his hair anymore than it was. Spare yourself and consider another spot. And to the barbers‚Ä¶. Please consider some additional training.",

          "Description": "I came in for a cut because I had a service to attend. The shop was in decent condition and the conversation was pretty good. The cut, however, was not good. Most times you can tell when a barber's clipper strokes are leading to a bad cut. That was definitely the case here. I asked for a bald fade and got something similar to a bowl cut since the line was not blended well at all. Upon checking the mirror when the cut concluded, I noticed only my left temple was faded correctly. I proceeded to ask the barber to blend the fade, and he attempted to do so. However, it did not look much different. I would have asked him to try again, but I did not want to end up with a high and tight. I was in a time crunch as well, and I knew I was going to have to fix my hair myself or go elsewhere at that point. I did go elsewhere, and my cut was fixed. I wish I could say that the experience was good since everyone was welcoming and the conversation was pretty good; however, the haircut was honestly one of the worst fades I have ever received. I really do not like leaving bad reviews, but in this particular case, I have to. The other barbers looked like they were doing at least decent jobs. I cannot say this shop is unable to execute other fades, but I would not recommend a bald fade.",

This place had the best reviews and was run by two women so I thought the vibes would be okay and safe. (I‚Äôm a lesbian with a men‚Äôs haircut and typical barbershops can be a little weird).\n\nHaircut was decent - job was done well and Suki and her sister were kind and friendly. I was planning on giving this place a good review! But while checking out they handed me a comic book/pamphlet which was all about Hell and how homosexuals (and whoremongers/liars/thieves/etc) were destined for hell.\n\nIf you‚Äôre LGBTQ+ I would recommend steering clear, unfortunately.",

The two ladies (particularly Kim) who run the place instead of asking you how you want your hair, will force you into awkward conversations about religion, a topic I would have no issue discussing but NOT when I'm getting my hair cut and in the company of complete strangers, it is very unprofessional and inappropriate. They also do not listen to your request(s) as they are cutting your hair, but insist on telling you (the customer) how short or long the cut should be. I politely tried to explain this to Kim but she became very offended. They also will yell back and forth to each other while cutting your hair. Sorry, but honestly they act like headcases. Edit add- they also rudely told me they stopped doing shampoos with no apologies.",

A good place for a professional looking cut. A lot of important customers, people who need to look good and tidy, but still reasonably priced.",

It was a crowded Saturday, yet I only waited 5 minutes. They made sure they clearly understood the style I want before starting. They even gave me the choice of a haircut by scissors or electric cutter. Everyone, including the other customers, was really friendly.  I especially liked the ambiance of the shop with the soft Latin music playing, the photos on the walls, and the multi-lingual conversations going on. And the price was very average and reasonable for DC. I'll definitely be returning to Diego's next time.",

          "Description": "For more than 2 years I have been getting the most incredible cut and service from Sage. I work in the area and passed Bishops all the time. When considering a transition from locs to a cut I looked at Bishops social media, hoping to find diverse clientele and an array of cuts offered. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt find that. I saw lots of soft layers, bright dye jobs, and not a diverse clientele. Still, because of the convenience, I walked in and spoke to the manager about the type of cut I was looking for and if there was someone who had experience cutting my textured hair. I was immediately directed to Sage.\n\nA week later and every two weeks since, Sage had nailed the cut that gets me stopped on the street daily and showered with hair compliments. Sage delivers every single time. She has helped with my post-loc thinning, entertained my color whims, my insistence on styling my hair myself, and through it all delivers this sickeningly clean cut.\n\nDo yourselves a favor and go see about Sage.",

They cut as I asked, and also helped me find a spot to eat after. 5 stars!",

However it doesn‚Äôt negate the fact if you don‚Äôt attend to all things concerning the business some may fall through the cracks tremendously. Here would be staff, the turn over rate is high because owner will hire staff, promise to train and doesn‚Äôt. When staff does things wrong he holds them accountable by ignoring them, blocking them and with holding their checks. Which is very unsettling for anyone who has bills and children. However Jared/owner says he believes in handling things in decency and order and this doesn‚Äôt suggest that at all. It‚Äôs also unsettling that anyone is getting charged a late fee/cancellation fee when there‚Äôs been several occasions where jared has cancels/rescheduled clients & and been late. Hopefully that at least the policy pertaining to that changes. Since theres now a ridiculous cancellation fee. If you wish to charge for those things you should also have a report of being punctual & or not cancelling appoints.

I sat in for about an hour and a half before anyone acknowledged my existence and when I was asked if I was waiting on anybody I was directed to one guy who said he had time but cut my hair entirely too fast it felt like just to get me out his chair so his next appointment could get in the chair. Fade is uneven. And it doesn‚Äôt match the other side. If you‚Äôve been going here for a while you‚Äôre probably fine but if you‚Äôre new and wanted to walk in expect to feel unseen and rushed out of a chair. I‚Äôd rather be told we don‚Äôt have time rather than say yes and speed through my cut. My first and last time in this shop. Certainly is not the ‚Äúbest‚Äù cuts",

He is the fourth person to cut my hair in DC and now will be the only person. I was still looking for the right Barber and now that I found Julio I can say he is my new official barber. I've been asked who cut my hair and I let them know about Julio. He gave me the haircut I asked for. I am afro-latino so I need someone that knows how to cut Black hair. You can tell he knows what he is doing and that he has been doing this for a while. I feel blessed to find the right barber. To anyone that is looking for the right Barber, your welcome lol",

They are quick and make sure that you are happy with the cut while you are in the chair. I haven‚Äôt had great luck with haircuts in this area because lots of the barbershops we went to didn‚Äôt have tougher combs or picks for kinky hair and they didn‚Äôt know how to cut his hair. We have had many  too many bad experiences but at the barber‚Äôs name is TRY(pronounced tree). He did an amazing job on my sons head we will definitely be loyal to him so we don‚Äôt have to drive from Georgetown to southeast. We can come right to tenleytown. Thank you TRY",

          "Description": "A haven for gents, highly approved by this lady!\n\nI recently surprised my boyfriend with a pamper day after seeing someone on TikTok talk about this place. Well, let's just say that the review was right and today my review comes from the perspectives of a happy girlfriend and approval of a very satisfied boyfriend.\n\nMy feedback: I simply love the way this place offers style, class, quality customer service, and comfort to all of their guests. I accompanied my boyfriend because it was a surprise to him and after checking in we were treated to a delicious cup of espresso with homemade cookies. In speaking with co-founder and master barber, Renata, this establishment prides itself on helping men find the confidence needed to regularly care for their skin and hair. Listen, I love a man who smells great and takes care of himself and it's important to do this independent of the approval of anyone else. So, if you have a partner and need to figure out the best way to support him, offer him a gift card to this place and encourage him to start the journey of self-care. Hey, let's tell the truth, men need love too!\n\nHis review: in the words of my boyfriend \"this was what I needed\". Co-founder, Claudia provided my boyfriend not only with the \"best\" first facial received but was dedicated in helping him understand his skin type, learning more about his daily skin care routines, and offering suggestions to help him improve his skin care without the stress. He told me that his face felt revitalized (I can confirm that my baby was glowing and his skin looked healthy) But he also mentioned how relaxed he felt with a shoulder, arms, and head massage to follow the facial. It was, in his words, a perfect gift and a great step in the right direction to care more for himself.\n\nFacial type: the Tesla\nPrice: under $150, this price after receiving an amazing first time offer. The regular prices are actually what I would pay for my own facials and I can say that it is so worth treating yourself to a good facial as much as you can.\n\nFacility: The decor is STUNNING! And still provides a very sexy vibes that any man would appreciate.\n\nThank you, Claudia and Renata, this place is a haven to relax! I highly recommend anyone purchasing gift cards (great stocking stuffers) and securing the services for the special men in your life. Let's put in more effort to uplifting  self care businesses such as this place, you won't regret it! I surely didn't. Seeing my special guy this happy made me smile even harder.",

Im very, very picky about how I get my hair cut, and she did a better job than any of the premiere barbers I've seen in Philadelphia.\n\nIncredible service and Incredible haircut.\n\nIt was such a perfect cut that I think im going to start coming to see my DC friends monthly just so Olga can cut my hair every 3-4 weeks.\n\nHighly, highly recommend Gents and Olga.\n\nThank you so very much!",

The young lady was barely cutting any hair, her hands were trembling, anything she did was superficial, she seemed really inexperienced and when she did cut hair instead of just touching it that was very uneven. It looks like I had hair cut in patches and I will still need another haircut elsewhere to salvage it. And even without considering all that, it's not cheap - they hiked up prices by 40%, so it's very sensible to pay $10 more elsewhere to have a legit haircut with a legit hairdresser who would be trained and who would know what they are doing.",

I didn't catch the other gentleman's name but he was fun and nice as well. I didn't see anyone smoking and the shop was clean and bright. My son was enamoured with the cat, which seems to be a huge selling point for him, while I really enjoyed the positive vibes and fast service.

The tapper the barber gave me was not blended well and my lining was not crisp at all. I could have did this myself. When I asked for a razor lining the barber did not use the razor properly and literally just stopped trying without handing me a mirror to look at the end results. That's not what I'm used to back at home in Chicago the cuts are a lot more precise.",

Walked over from my hotel in Georgetown, and was greeted by a We-work style building, on the fifth floor of which Jon has a suite. Took me a minute to explain what I wanted (which is perhaps a little more complex than a regular haircut) and he knew exactly what I needed. 30 minutes later I was out, after having received a top notch high bald skin fade and a beard razor line up. I guess Google does get things right sometimes, and I'm glad I found this professional, reasonably priced business. Thanks, Jon. I'll be sure to look you up when I'm back.\n\nPS: On an unrelated note, I just wanted to say Jon is an impressive dude. Dreadlocks, massive biceps, scrubs and mask on, and impeccable manners.",

I noticed that the shop is not well kept as there was hair everywhere as well as cutting tools all over the place.\n\nA few weeks later I decided to give this place another try. During my second visit the barber I went to was talking to people the whole time while cutting my hair and was very distracted. He half assed my cut and took his sweet time while he talked to people in the shop. Not to mention before he even started to cut my hair I told him specifically not to shape my beard up but he did it anyway!\n\nWill not go back to this barber shop. They are more places that give you what you pay for.",

I rescheduled the appointment and then the guy turn around and cancelled it because I missed the appointment. I don‚Äôt miss appointment often and I always leave a tip. I would never send my son back to this establishment because of their rudeness. This establishment needs a late policy or something because I called to cancel it. NEVER GO HERE IF YOU HAVE A LIFE AND PLAN TO CANCEL OR SOMETHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENS CAUSE THE BARBERS WILL NOT LET YOU RESCHEDULE!!!!",

There needs to be some type of rotation between the workers depending on whose chair is  available to cut at the particular time for each walk in customer when the barber becomes available unless  the walk in customer has a recommendation. I am definitely rooting for street cuttz to progress however everyone needs to be in  unison.",

Great value too as these guys more than deserve the tip they are undoubtedly due, and more.\n\nWhatever you are looking for, these guys are professionals, craftsmen, and show a humility around learning more about their professional that many others sadly lack.\n\nCannot recommend them enough!

I have been between barbers this year and overall really unsatisfied in my home city, so this was a refreshing change of pace which made me wish I came around DC more.\n\nMy bandmate and friend had his haircut as well by another barber who I didn't catch the name of, but she seemed to give very thoughtful consultation and helped my friend to figure out how to describe his ideal haircut to barbers in the future. Nice decor, and seems to be a busy enough spot but with enough chairs that I could make an appointment with short notice. Many thanks",

          "Description": "I made an appointment at this barbershop to support a Black-owned business like I usually do. I booked with Jerod, arrived 15 minutes early, and patiently waited. My appointment time came and went. No explanation. I asked if I‚Äôd still be seen‚Äîanother barber assured me, ‚ÄúJerod will call you shortly.‚Äù\n\nThe customer before me left. 10 more minutes. Still no Jerod. I asked if someone else could cut my hair since I needed to return to work. They sent me to an apprentice. I figured, okay, maybe he knows what he‚Äôs doing.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nI got home, and my husband took one look at me and screamed, ‚ÄúPur√©e!!!‚Äù The left side of my face was steeply cleaned. I didn‚Äôt ask for that. The right side? Uneven, untrimmed‚Äîa complete disaster. For $45 haircut on very short hair. It was a fair deal. I expected a simple but, professional cut for my job interview. What I got was a half-finished experiment.\n\nAnd Jerod? Never showed. Never apologized. I left the shop wondering‚Äîwas this just bad service, or something more? Would I have been treated this way if I were someone else than an African woman?\nI really don‚Äôt know. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt just lucky? I could really forgive the apprentice (it was unfortunate that he had to learn on my head at the time that I need a perfect cut) and I understand the rest of the crew were trying to help‚Ä¶ but the lack of professionalism from the barber I was booked with‚Ä¶.",

          "Description": "I‚Äôm sharing my experience at this barbershop hair salon because it was the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had. I had an appointment with Stylist named BRITTANY. For starters I was on time for my appointment a little early and she hadn‚Äôt arrived yet. Her husband said she is parking will be in shortly. Okay I waited watching the door no Brittany after about 30 minutes or so I told my husband I was ready to leave he said let‚Äôs wait some more. I‚Äôm thinking where is she since her husband said she‚Äôs parking out front. Still waiting I tried to get my husband to leave he said again let‚Äôs wait for a few minutes more. Her husband watching me and my husband interaction stepped away in the back to call her and came out to say she‚Äôs on her way in. How is that when he told me she was parking when I arrived now about an hour or more has passed. In steps in Brittany I‚Äôm assuming she never acknowledged me didn‚Äôt even look my way. Came in talking to everyone else except me went outside for about another 15 minutes or more came back in walked around talking to everyone except me never identified herself. I‚Äôm still wanting to leave but again listening to my husband I stayed. When she decided to wash my hair she still talking you know what thinking I‚Äôm unaware saying thanks Martell as if I‚Äôm getting on her nerves. He took her in the back again I‚Äôm thinking this was the worst thing I‚Äôve done was to step in this filthy shop. She braided my hair so TIGHT that it looked like I had stitches instead of braids. Even when she finished her husband looked on with a look of disbelief. I had sores on my scalp and with the touch of a finger my scalp turned red looked like it was bleeding. I was livid and scared because I had never had cornrows before but I knew this was not supposed to happen. This happened in February and my scalp still has dry patches in it. Had to go to a dermatologist and the Medicine she has prescribed is not working. My dermatologist was perplexed as to what is going on with my scalp. I even tipped this ‚Äî‚Äî-h  $25.00. I made another appointment with Ms Brittany just so she will know how it feels to wait on someone and did she think I was dumb enough to come back after that experience. Pray I don‚Äôt sue you because I know I can for what you did how evil and mean and stupid are you. Again this is July and I‚Äôm still going to the dermatologist. Also Mr. Martell my husband does not look like MARTIN LUTHIER KING.but you look like a gorillas‚Äî- when I took out my braids I had a huge ball of hair in my hands",

The man who cut my hair did it nice, I told him I wanted to do something dramatic, and he gave me a fresh looking cut.\n\nOnly thing I'll say is if you're a *bushy* beard guy, don't go for the beard trim. I can't say he did a bad job on it, the beard looks nice enough, but I came out with a very different style than I was hoping for. It's going to take a while for the moustache to grow back bushy like I like it! üòÖ I would trust this place to shape a tight, modern, stylish beard (frankly, the type most people like), but if you want it long and funky, shell out extra $$ for a barber with a bushy beard. (Frankly, that's good beard advice generally -- you want your beard trimmed by the guy with the beard you want!)",

Diane is friendly and will listen to your guidance very well.  My hair is short and a little curly with a few \"cow licks\" which presents only minimal challenge.  I recommend weekdays in the morning or as a second choice weekday afternoons to avoid waiting too long 5-10 minutes.  Please tell her Mr. Kevin sent you.  I. do not receive any compensation for this. $25 which includes my $5 tip.   The shop itself is bare bones with seating for approximately 10 waiting.  Enjoy!",

The staff were very friendly and welcoming, and the place has a lovely neighborhood feel, with locals popping in and out just to say hi. There was a bit of a line, but it moved very quickly. I keep my hair longer than most men, so am always cautious at a new barber. The barber here was extremely thorough and maticulous, and took his time giving me the perfect cut. This was by far the most attention I ever got at a barbershop. At 30$ it was much cheaper than much worse cuts I got at \"trendier\" shops. Would come here again for all my future cuts!",

          "Description": "I was in town for the day and needed a clean up. Found this place and met Stoney and the gang. Only had to wait about 15 minutes before I got in the chair. Juan was my barber. I asked for a tight fade with a dark top. That is basically what I got and was decently satisfied with the results. With that being said, I was not satisfied with the haircut process itself. Juan's technique was jabby and harsh. I often felt the clippers hit directly against my skin before trimming, leaving rough patches of bluntly cut hair and was abrasive on my skin. He trimmed under my neck without much care causing bad razor burn and uneven texture. My hair is fairly soft and I have had really smooth fades but this fade turned out choppier likely due to the quick flick technique he used.\n\nI had the opportunity to watch Stoney cut a few clients and his technique was much smoother, with really clean lines and the guys came out sharp without too much irritation, from what I could tell. Juan was also distracted by his phone during the cut, which I understand happens when you're working all day, but I think that affected his overall performance.\n\nIn photos the pinkish areas are where I experienced the most discomfort from clipper burn. My under neck hurt the most. I trim my neck with my own electric trimmer and have never been scratched up like that. I use witch hazel, shea butter, and aloe vera to help the healing process. I plan to use a light salt or sugar scrub over the next few days to help soften the hair to prevent in-grown hairs and further irritation.\n\nOverall, the cut turned out alright and $30 wasn't too bad given it's DC, though I have had cleaner for less. The guys were really cool and I appreciate a Black owned barbershop doing their best, but I would recommend tightening up the practice with more consideration of skin and hair textures for even better results.",

Stylebar's Kanika is the best stylist for blondes in all of DC! I have been going to her for 2 years now, and I have referred 7-10 friends to her throughout this time - each of them has\nbeen amazed at Kanika's coloring abilities. The picture, which shows my hair after committing to Kanika as my stylist, shows her ability for itself!\n\nI'd also like to add that being blonde can be expensive; Kanika, however, recommends that I intermittently substitute toning sessions for dyes,\ntherefore keeping me as blonde as possible without draining my wallet. I appreciate this greatly.\n\nShe has the clients best interest at heart and - in all honesty - knows what I want and need more than I do. I cannot recommend her services enough!",

He is truly one of the most generous, loving and empathetic people I have ever met.\n\nI was traveling to DC to speak at a conference on behalf of my 5 year-old son battling a rare neurological disease.  I had received a bad hair cut and highlights before I left Dallas.  Salim took me in last minute and fixed everything.  I explained to him why I was in DC and his kindness was palpable.  He did not charge me for my hair.  Rather, he said I put that money toward curing my son.\n\nI felt the salon feeling beautiful and nailed the speech the entire day.

And the service was fast- I have a lot of hair and it has taken 5+ hours at other salons and Salim was able to to finish my hair in 3 hours! I've been getting my hair done for over a decade and have been blonde for 6 years so I'm really picky about who does my hair and I will definitely be coming back!",

James, on the other hand, rocks. He's extremely skilled, detail-oriented, diligent, and communicative. I always leave the salon satisfied with his work. He's also just a really nice guy. He's interesting, funny, super easy to talk to, and very social so there's never awkward silence while I'm in the chair.\n\nThe City Vista location is also gorgeous. Bang Salon just built out the place, and it seems like they hired a skilled interior designer to decorate. I absolutely adore the vibe, and it feels modern, put-together, and moody while remaining relaxing and inviting. It's definitely a huge improvement over their old location next to Capital One Arena.\n\nI find that downtown DC is really lacking in accessible, quality salons, and Bang Salon City Vista definitely fits that niche. It's priced competitively, and the services are outstanding, as discussed above.",

He was sitting by the window, looking eager for a client, so I decided to give him a chance. While he did an acceptable job on the lower taper temporal, he struggled with my Afro cut. Unfortunately, he didn't inform me that he wasn't skilled in cutting Afro hair. After washing my hair, I saw how poorly it was done and had to shave it all off to start over. It's clear he doesn't have experience with extremely curly hair and should have communicated this upfront. But all good, I could see all barbers are mixture of professional and amateur",

I had to wait a few weeks because it was that bad. I went to Raheem he already knew what happened and fixed me up right. Raheem has been consistent responsive and dedicated to his craft. I have sent friends to him and they have been just as pleased as me. I get a taper fade wavelength and he got it right the first time and I go to him every two weeks. I constantly get compliments on my haircut and people ask me who cuts me I tell them where and they show up. I have seen him cut other styles too. Most importantly his customer service is top of the line responsive and great guy all around.",

It isn't a bad cut, but it's not what I asked for. That's the risk you take when you're dealing with walk-ins. Also, it's 2024, why is it cash-only?",

Not only are they all passionate experts with at least 30+ years of experience, but they have MASTERED the European cut. I lived in Italy for a year and no other barbers could match the Milanese haircut, but these fellows do so with aplomb. I literally don't ever have to worry going into them, they know how to cut hair and do it WELL. They recognize what you want so you don't have to ask each time. They're also personable and I love speaking Italian with them. Barbershops like these are a dying breed so I hope they continue to last for generations to come. I'd drive two hours to get their cuts if I had to and would give them 10 stars if I could - highly, HIGHLY recommended!!",
