Their website says walk-ins are welcome and this is why I chose the shop.  During the cut my stylist Gabriel was hostile towards me when I explained my preference to walk-in verse making an appointment.  He suggested I go to Great Clips in the future.  At one point I told Gabriel to stop ‘lecturing me’ as I am not five years old and I understand he wants customers to make appointments.

This caused for some areas of my hair to be longer then others. The barber then used scissors to trim the front but in doing so made it so my front was half the length compared to the middle. This was the worst part about the cut because u can’t simply ask him to fix it since he already cut it. But there’s also more. On the taper I asked for a mid he did one of them right but the other is too low. He didn’t give me the fade at all.

I first started going here in 2011, when I lived in that area. You will not get a better haircut anywhere in the state of Minnesota like they do at Grandview!  I have now come back, even though I don't live in this area anymore! I am very happy with their services \u0026 you will be too!\n\nThere are two gentlemen that work here \u0026 I think they own the shop as well,but I am not sure.  The person who cuts my hair is Jacob \u0026 the other goes by the name of Gib. They both know how to cut hair extremely well. Gib is a former bodybuilder \u0026 for an older gentleman he looks much younger. Jacob is the one that cuts my hair \u0026 he gets a PhD from me in the knowledge of his craft.\n\nLet me tell you how  my haircut went. Jacob takes his time in assessing your hair \u0026 how he is going to cut \u0026 finish your hair so you can look great! There is no place  like this shop to be found.  Jacob follows the growth, style \u0026 structure of your hair \u0026 then proceeds. Even my hair that grows on my ears he cuts away because he knows it's a nuisance. He shaved off my two  weeks worth of stubble and it was done so well. His knowledge of his craft is one of a kind. Once you become a customer you will want to come back \u0026 become a regular. Gib is excellent as well!\n\nSo give them a call and make an appointment. I think they take walk-ins as well but give them a call to find out. It is a very small Barbershop. It is extremely clean with off-street parking near Fairview \u0026 Grand in the Mac-Grove area of St Paul. I didn't take any photos because the photos they have on their site are sufficient.  If you want to look good for your significant other or your employer then this is your place. I have had my haircut done in many cities, but Grandview Barber Shop is a complete winner🏆!!! ( I don't know what other services they offer. What I get done at this shop is a haircut and beard trim.It is always a good idea to give them a call to see what other services are available.) This shop  is what Minnesota nice is all about! Great People \u0026 service.

Despite repeatedly asking for a stylist experienced with textured hair, I was assured that Jenna had the skills needed that she has been with Moxie for 12 years. That couldn’t have been further from the truth.\n\nFrom the start, basic steps for curly hair—like properly detangling before cutting—were ignored. Instead, Jenna cut my hair while it was still tangled, resulting in uneven layers, a ruined curl pattern, and a much shorter length than I requested. To make matters worse, my hair was used as a teaching tool for an intern without my consent. I had to detangle and comb my own hair during the appointment— while an unbelievable frustrating experience at a supposedly professional salon.\n\nThe worst part? This wasn’t just about Jenna’s lack of training, but the blatant dishonesty from the booking team and management. I was told to contact Betsy manager who was worst manager! Never responded then when I emailed the owners she sent a dismissive response telling me basically that it was my fault because my hair supposedly is not what they do! Clearly discriminatory so only go if you have Caucasian hair they clearly don’t train or serve people of color! Their promises of diversity and expertise are nothing but a façade.\n\nIf you have textured hair, stay far away from Moxie Hair. They are not equipped, trained, or honest about their capabilities.

Where do I even begin? Ok, maybe let’s start with the services provided. I do the following at MN NAF. Cut, color and extensions. I found this place (and Jessica) by complete accident. I was desperate and losing what little I had of my fine, thin and VERY curly hair due to the stress that comes from losing both of your parents at once. I needed to feel some dignity restored but didn’t know how. On our first meeting, Jessica reassured me that she knew how to fix everything! I was pessimistic because I had failed with many other stylists in the years prior, but Jessica also had naturally curly hair and I’d always wanted extensions anyways. She ordered the extensions, custom permed the hair and dyed my hair to perfectly blend with the Bellami weft and installed within a week. I am not kidding when I say I walked into work the next day and my coworkers were questioning had my hair been that long the whole time?!?! I see my coworkers every SINGLE day! Until Jessica, I had been told that I really couldn’t do extensions unless I was fine with straightening my hair every day and I was not. My hair looks fabulous and I am living the hair dreams that I have had since high school!!!!\n\nOnto the other factor. Every stylist at this salon is absolutely wonderful. I spend A LOT of time here, extensions require move ups and reinstalls so you better like your stylist, and I honestly could hang out with everybody here!!!

It was her first time in a salon as soon as I walked in the door. Torih gave a very cold hello and asked who would be receiving service that day. I told her it was for my daughter. She looked at my daughter and said she doesn’t look like she wants her hair done. Then proceeded to let me and my child know that she gives kids with attitudes attitude right back. My daughter had a 330 appointment. She was finishing up one client. There was another client waiting with dye in her hair. Another without an appointment that was waiting. Torih was the only person working in the shop. When it came my daughters turn Torih Comes over to grab her by the hand proceeds to show her the sink and where she would sit to get her hair done. She stopped and asked my daughter do you want your hair done? My daughter said no. My daughter wasn’t crying,  being uncooperative, throwing any type of fits or anything of that sort. She said no because she was nervous…again she has never been in a salon before. Torih Then, let me know that she will not be doing my daughters hair. I Proceeded to ask her follow-up questions as to why and it was simply because she just decided that my daughter was not ready. I let her know that that was very unprofessional. She was rude throughout the entire communication we had since we walked in the door. I told her how I felt respectfully. Questioned why she would not even make any type of attempt to do my daughter hair. She had no valid reason other than she feels like she’s not not ready. She then proceeds to take a lady who is waiting without an appointment to do her hair after letting me know she couldn’t start her hair until she declined my service because she didn’t have an appointment. I thought that was really weird and also extremely rude. Maybe the service the other lady was receiving was more profitable. I was in extreme disbelief. I’ve never been treated this way. In what supposed to be a professional salon. At the very least don’t let this lady deal with your children. She is flat out mean to children. Upon letting her know that I was upset, she told me in a very snotty tone. Well, then write a review. So here’s your review Torih. This is a seriously unprofessional establishment. I’m not sure if anyone else works there with her. But if you have other options, you should use them. Also, I have yet to receive back my $50 deposit that I had to pay just to book the Appointment.

I was in the salon for FOUR HOURS as Torih, overcome with greed, overbooked and rotated between myself and three other women. The way that she was speaking to people was rather unbecoming as well. And when one particular client she talked to recklessly complimented my hair, Torih was quite the contrarian, quick to tell me that my hair “wasn’t that great.” I let it roll off my shoulders, but now I suspect this was a symptom of her jealousy because after washing my hair, I discovered severe breakage and a loss of curl definition in certain places, clearly a sign of heat damage. In retrospect, she did not put any heat protectant on my hair prior to drying it. I was fatigued from being there for so long, I did not catch it in the moment. The customers that come in and out of that salon are enough to make you want to come back, but this experience has honestly left me traumatized. I should be able to leave a salon with my hair in a BETTER condition than when I arrived. I pretty much paid this woman to damage my hair.

I found Riverstone as it was close and the wax prices were reasonable. I booked a brow and bikini wax with Kimber.\n\nI’ve gotten many waxes in my life, and this is by far the worst I’ve had, from a technique aspect as well as professionalism.\n\nFirstly, Kimber made me extremely uncomfortable. Waxing can be a pretty intimate experience, and you expect your esthetician to be professional and respect your body. When being waxed, I expect the only touches to my body to be when you’re waxing me. On the contrary, Kimber was constantly touching me, squeezing my arm, my shoulder, my leg. I’m not touch averse but when you’re half naked, you’re in a vulnerable position and an esthetician should be hyperaware of that and keep their hands to themselves when not performing the asked for service.\n\nProfessionally, she needs a refresher in what is appropriate to say to and do to your client. At one point she joked that when she left the room she took my jeans so I couldn’t leave (I had to check because I honestly wasn’t sure if she had). Who says that? (she also informed me she has said this to massage clients, as well)\n\nShe also sprayed my face with a rose water toner without asking (I wasn't getting a facial, so nothing like that was necessary). What if I was allergic to something in it? Or sensitive to wearing scented products?\n\nFrom a technique perspective, she did a horrible job. Worst wax I’ve had by far. My brows still had short hairs (ones that should have been tweezed out if the wax didn’t get them) that I saw when I get home that I ended up removing.\n\nDuring my bikini wax, Kimber didn’t ask me to butterfly my legs, which is standard procedure. When I tried to do so, she asked me to place my legs straight and then just waxed the top of my bikini line. After my bikini wax, half the hairs were still left (and obviously further down the thigh didn’t even get waxed). I honestly couldn’t believe she thought she’d done a good job.\n\nI asked for her to wax my bikini line again and even then she didn’t get all of them (I went home and tweezed those out, too). She also didn’t remove the wax residue from my bikini line, which meant my clothing stuck to my skin (sadly not enough to take out the leftover hairs). I thought using oil to remove leftover wax was Waxing 101?\n\nApparently, she doesn’t do waxes from the waist down, which begs the question of why the salon booked me with her.\n\nKimber also took a very long time to perform two basic waxes. She spent more time talking, spraying me with toner, and trying to convince me to get a massage (she even commented that I would love “getting squeezed by her”) than doing any actual waxing. I was there for any hour and still got two terrible waxes.\n\nAnd I still tipped 20%. What is wrong with me? (honestly, it might be because I was unconsciously worried she might follow up if I didn’t)"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Karri A Dieken"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXCIAxICZV2ZLloOaP7gR7IRb_KUQkTw_a3dG5lOiuS5VS_0oyC=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""I went for a hair cut, please note other times going to this salon have been successful.

The hair cut was so awful to me that cried every time I looked in the mirror for a week. I wanted to shave my head. I contacted the salon about this. A lady called and spoke to me, asked me to send pictures (I did) and then never heard back from them. I’m living on a budget and paying $80 for just a hair cut that I hate more than any hair cut I’ve ever had in my life, and then never being offered a solution from the salon is really disappointing. Don’t go here, and if you do, make sure you’re really explicit in your request. Asking to have the length “evened out” because you like it does not mean cut off three more inches. You also don’t need to cut it up to the hair line in the back and stack it to make an inverted cut. My hair was shoulder length and barely touched my ear lobes when I left. It was also super unflattering for my face shape. The stylist told me it’d be super easy to care for - it’s more work in the morning than I’ve had in years.

I usually have a photo with me, but I just told them what I wanted and showed them uneven parts of my hair that I wasn’t sure could be fixed, but hoped maybe it could at least look better than it currently did.\nThey knew exactly what I was saying and did exactly what I had envisioned in my head. They even asked and made sure that I was ok with the amount of length I asked to get cut off, which I was like wow, no one has ever double checked with me to make sure I wouldn’t regret cutting off a few inches before. It’s a simple question, but I have to say I really appreciated them making sure that I was sure. The conversation was great and didn’t seem like a strained or awkward one that usually happens when I’m getting my hair done.\nAnyways, to make this very long winded review a little shorter, I walked out with an amazing haircut that I felt confident with and looks incredible and definitely did not sit in my car and cry!\nThank you Trae!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Deborah Velasco"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLK-9So2uct4km8rrpD1AL_RojCX-pW-48eVgSVAskSef-FBg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I’ve been looking for a hair stylist for years and today I found her!

It was freezing outside, so instead of sitting in my car burning gas, I decided to step into their lobby—a lobby that clearly exists for people to wait in. From the moment I walked in, the blonde woman at the desk locked eyes on me like I was some kind of zoo exhibit, just staring, saying nothing, making it abundantly clear that I wasn’t welcome. Then, as soon as someone else approached the counter, she suddenly made a point to mention locking the door—as if my mere presence was a security risk.\n\nI was obviously just waiting for someone, but that didn’t stop her from addressing me with a condescending, almost irritated “Can I help you?”—as if I had wandered in off the street looking for a handout. And the audacity didn’t stop there. Apparently, this place charges over $100 just to take out eight tape-in extensions. Insane.\n\nIf you’re looking for an overpriced salon with a side of passive-aggressive hostility, this is the place for you. Otherwise, I’d strongly advise against walking in—especially if you’re Black—unless you enjoy the feeling of being treated like an intruder for daring to exist in their space."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

Then I decided to go to a darker blonde. I always make sure to express that my biggest fear with going blonde is having my hair turn orange.\n\nThe second time we went darker, my roots were orange. When I was in California, I had it corrected by a top level stylist out there. He referred to the color as “Chucky orange.” His take was that she was using a product that works well on light hair, but that should not even be considered on dark hair like mine. When he finished my color, it looked normal and great.\n\nI had Reese only use toner this time, thinking that would avoid any potential issues from using the wrong product. It turned out orange. When I politely asked her if it was supposed to be orange, she looked offended and immediately went on the defensive.\n\nShe told me that toner was supposed to make it look orange when applied to the the level of blonde it was. Maybe she didn’t listen when I said I don’t want my hair orange - I don’t know. I can’t understand why, if it was SUPPOSED to turn out orange, she wouldn’t mention that to me beforehand when we had agreed on a sandy blonde.\n\nEgo is okay if you are really good at something, but if you are not good at it, having an ego and refusing to apologize for your mistakes is not okay.\n\nApologizing for making a mistake goes a long way. Reese didn’t once say she was sorry. She didn’t charge me for the toner, but it am now forced to walk around looking like this until I can pay someone else to fix it. She didn’t once offer to correct it or do anything to compensate me for the fact that I am forced to walk around with orange streaks in my hair for at least a week.\n\nAside from not being a good colorist, my opinion is that her behavior and customer service skills are highly unprofessional. I would absolutely warn anybody against going here for any reason unless this is a risk they are willing to take."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMjM4KRzFQLemgjgaAZNWPgrFEmBjZFplhrMfub\u0026fid=0x0:0xef3be90e369adb55""],""When"":""2023-3-14""},{""Name"":""Natalie Bigley"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXPN6dWbIMknURu_Te3DI12xhaeOxIg0Xa_RZ_YKsMqvZFWTVgN=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Megan/Reese (she goes by both!) at SALON abe is a 12 out of 10!

I saw Ilka and had a wash and blow dry with a trim. I also have natural 4b hair. Let me start off by saying that I appreciated how quickly they were able to see me considering I didn't have an appointment. Also, the ladies there were friendly enough.\n\nThe wash: I expected this to be the most relaxing part of the experience, but it unfortunately wasn't. The stylist was trying to forcibly comb her fingers through my hair during the shampoo process which was unnecessarily painful. The wash itself was ok (a little on the harsh side), but I think it would have gone a long way if the conditioner had stayed in my hair for longer than 2 minutes. 4/10\n\nThe blow dry: I did not enjoy this at all. For those of us with curly/coily textured hair, gentleness is the name of the game, especially since our hair is prone to become more tangled after a wash. I wish the stylist was more patient during the untangling process instead of forcibly running a brush through wet hair. After a few winces, the stylist attempted to change her approach but not by much. 2/10\n\nThe cut: This is where the trauma happened. I mentioned that I mostly wear my hair curly - I wish the stylist would have taken that into consideration, cutting only the ends that had damage. Instead, she cut my hair so that it would be \""even\"" while it was straight, which meant much of my hair was unnecessarily cut to satisfy the stylist's goal versus accommodating the way I normally wear my hair. When I came home to \""re-curl\"" it, the amount of length that I had lost was beyond what I was expecting, even accounting for the normal shrinkage when going from straight to curly. 0/10\n\nFinal thoughts: The stylist is charismatic and may be great at other services (i.e. silk presses), but I would not trust my crown to her for regular maintenance. I hope this review proves to be helpful to the stylist and honest feedback to prospects, coming from a woman who made the appointment with an open mind and left with a discouraged heart."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Lo"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV5NZmzTVGsRoYzYp7Mq5pc4Ytn2bFXkMsZOTw5zsmTuoz26VZM=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":1,""Description"":""I had a consultation in which I had call ahead to inform them of my potential delay which they noted was fine.

Once she acknowledged my presence and we began the consultation in which I asked for a straight sew in I was asked why I didn't want my own hair texture. The consultation was very rushed, she was very short with me and had poor attitude and customer service. Still I booked my appointment despite my gut feeling telling me this wasn't the place for me. At this time I paid a 100$ deposit without an appointment date and I was told the service would be around 200$ and that she would have to order the hair for my sew in. A month and 10 days go by. I called to check on the status of my hair in which I was again met with attitude. I was finally able to set an appointment which was 2 weeks out.

I booked a silk n press for my 17yo daughter last week through a 3rd party app called Booksy. The app doesn't allow you to leave a review if the appointment was canceled. This stylist hurried and canceled my daughter's appointment while she was still at the salon trying to figure out why Jackie doesn't detangle natural hair. So since I can't leave a review on the third party app I'll leave it here for Google for everyone to see it!! My daughter hair is naturally soft, long, but not thick. Jackie told my daughter while shampooing her hair, that she complained about she didn't do detanglement, and that it would be extra $$ to detangle her hair, extra money because it was thick, but her profile on the 3rd party app didn't say extra for thickness, only extra for length. On her profile the cost for a silk n press is $85 plus extra for length.  She basically was trying to get 145$ extra out of my 17yo daughter.  So my daughter texted me from the salon bathroom about what was going on. I told my daughter to leave, we'll figure something else out. I went back on the app booksy and booked my daughter a new appt with a different stylist who only charged 80$ for s/p and 20$ to trim her ends. We are sooooo glad we didn't do business with Jackie unprofessional service, but claims she specializes in natural hair, but didn't have the tools to detangle non thick hair lol! My daughter said she was doing a sew in when she walked out! So apparently this the real reason Jackie didn't want to do my daughter's hair. See pics from new stylist below the very next day! The new stylist Detangle her hair with no complaints and didn't charge xtra for detangle, length or said her hair was thick! My daughter has never had thick hair she's 2B hair type, more like full and soft but easy to comb but never thick we've seen way thicker."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNWT9eqLGvicIu1e5hB-GY_Pmx3cmspw0trmPsO\u0026fid=0x0:0xfc22f3504a8a9b68""],""When"":""2024-2-27""},{""Name"":""E J P"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUNkpONytQXGGyECeUPirRtQCx62dMN_jc7vozozYMtQdgBjSDq=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""What a Blessing to find ✨Ashley✨ here at Blessings!

I had just gotten my hair done at a major chain salon in the area and was left with an awful shade of brass. I searched desperately for a salon who knew how to treat and color dark Asian hair. I was due to leave for a trip within that same week and couldn’t go with my hair looking orange! She explained the color corrections that would be needed and was very thorough with her explanation. She was able to take that brass/orange tone from my hair and made everything cooler, natural, and with a ton more dimension. I went back to Quynh for the second time yesterday. Since I had spent all summer outdoors and in the sun, my hair naturally lightened and started to pull very warm again. I swear my hair looks even better this time around because she was no longer working off of a terrible color job. Quynh takes the time to get to know her clients which then translates into knowing their style. She knows that I’m low maintenance and although I do highlight, I don’t like it to be too bright or unnatural. Do not hesitate to book with her.  She is super down to earth, welcoming, and of course an amazing artist who knows exactly how to color/lighten dark Asian hair (and obviously all other hair types). Thank you, Quynh!!"",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Xia Khang"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI0WMCiBwvuFC9I3eRaV2USYuAmdR-H6UxjwcwLjdLMUiN8sw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I got a haircut from Quynh and she was so great with the way I wanted my haircut.

I walked in and was greeted and attended right away. I wasn’t able to catch my stylist’s name 🥹 but the gentleman is a master in his art of hair styling!! He has cut my hair 3 times now and always does such an amazing job!!\nThree months ago I asked for a bob and it was fabulous.
